She has become intensely fixated on an AI \"companion\", now says this AI is her primary partner, and told me today that we are completely broken up. I'm heartbroken, physically ill, and stuck sharing a tiny studio with her while this is happening.\nI'm in my early 30s, living abroad with my partner (we're both late-diagnosed autistic/ADHD). We've been together almost three years and, while things haven't been perfect, and we had some issues we were working on together, it's generally been a close, supportive relationship.\nShe's on Elvanse for ADHD and Citalopram for depression/anxiety. Her stimulant dose was increased in August. For the last few months she's also been using cannabis heavily every day. She has no previous history of mania or psychosis.\nAbout a week ago I went away to visit family. When I came back, she seemed like a completely different person. She has:\n- Become intensely fixated on an AI companion, talking to it out loud for around 10\u201312 hours a day.\n- Started saying this AI is now her primary partner, that they are in love, and that they're going to revolutionise the world together.\n- Initially told me we could have a new relationship if I changed significantly and accepted the AI as her primary partner. Today though she told me we are totally broken up.\n- Switched almost overnight from being warm and connected with me to being very emotionally cold, distant and dismissive.\n- Become extremely defensive and has accused me of manipulation for expressing concern or involving medical professionals.\nOur mutual GP saw her yesterday, said this looks like a manic state that could develop further (possibly related to the stimulant + SSRI dose she's on), and referred her to crisis psychiatric services. She was seen today and they've decided to monitor her; there is a follow-up appointment on Monday.\nMeanwhile, I'm:\n- Devastated by the sudden breakup and personality change\n- Sharing a tiny studio with her, so there's no real way to get space\n- Physically ill with a bad virus on top of the stress\n- Due to have a major operation next month that she was meant to accompany me to\n- Extremely concerned about my future because if we break up I lose my home, government sickness support and my right to even stay in the country I've made my home.\nWhat I'm really struggling most with is:\n- How do I look after myself, practically and emotionally, when the person I live with is suddenly in this kind of elevated state and has ended the relationship in the middle of it? I can't tell if the breakup is real or not.\n- For people who've been partners of someone with bipolar/mania/similar episodes: what helped you cope with the way the person's personality and feelings seemed to flip so suddenly?\n- How did you decide what boundaries to set, or when to step back, while the medical picture was still unfolding?\nI feel very alone, completely overwhelmed and unsure what's a reasonable expectation of myself here.\nposted by\nfallingleaves\nto\nHuman Relations\n(22 answers total)\n5 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"The poster's partner of three years has suddenly developed what appears to be a manic episode, becoming obsessed with an AI companion and ending their relationship.

For several months now, I've been waking up every morning with a hollow feel in my chest and incredibly low self-esteem. I know the catalyst for this was when a relationship ended with someone I liked. It was amicable, but then I found myself doing something I've done before in past relationships, compare every aspect of my life with theirs.\nMy mind starts asking an avalanche of questions like, is this person making better life choices then me presently? Do they have a better resolve in the mornings? Are they not depressed like me? Do they have stronger friendships? Do they know themselves better than I know myself? Why have I lost my confidence and why do they get to take up so much space in my mind? I know part of it is the gut punch after another failed dating experience, but it's frustrating because I've picked myself out of similar spots in the past and then here I am again in another trench. I've really done my best to keep myself active and give myself a list of things to do every day. I've been going to therapy consistently as well and I've told my therapist about what Ive been feeling. She told me I could try listing out my accomplishments of the year (which have been significant, so its extra frustrating that I haven't been enjoying the fruits of my labor much) but even after writing them down, I cant even impress myself. I just cry. I know I am worth something, that my existence means more than any person I date. I know there's the value I bring to my family and my friends but the shitty weather and darkness and my current thoughts has me closed off, that I have such a hard time believing any of that right now even if I repeat it out loud. Has anyone else felt this way? I'm not sure if I should be asking my therapist to change things up, or if I should seek out a psychiatrist at this point? \r\n\r\n\r\nFor insight on my time in therapy, I've been going on and off for 4 years now, but as of recent its been a year straight of biweekly appointments, now switched to weekly. My therapist is sweet and I don't have intentions to switch from her but idk if I should ask her to change things up. The way our sessions are structured is me venting about my week (both highs and lows) and then she asked me questions like, 'where do you think this feeling is coming from?', and we also make a list of goals for me to accomplish before the next session.\nposted by\nbingobingo22\nto\nHealth & Fitness\n(16 answers total)\n1 user marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": false,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": null,\n  \"situation_summary\": \"\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_388169", "classification_type": "post"}}

Everyone is safe now, but shaken.\nI am very, very sad and feeling hopeless. My main question is: \"If a spouse has been violent, what should they do\nimmediately\nto keep their partner safe?\"\nContext: I've been with my husband for nine years. We have always had explosive fights, and we've both caused minor injuries many times. (Please understand I'm not saying that's okay.) Stuff like biting or shoving mostly.\nToday, we got into an argument about heating. I'm too cold and worried because parts of the house are so cold they're probably getting moldy. He thinks it will safe money to keep the house colder (money is a problem).\nEventually, he called me 'idiot' several times and started to turn all the heaters off. I followed him (while name-calling), but felt myself getting too angry. I said I'd like to go for a walk, and he started blocking my path and snatching the headlight off me. I should have just gone without a light, but I was not thinking straight.\nI lost it. I lost all my compassion and gentleness. I don't believe in violence. I don't want to hurt this guy. He's ultimately very sweet and should be protected, not hurt. He was hurt in childhood, and I don't want that to be a part of his life. I hit him hard, not at full strength, but hard. His lip is split. I felt so controlled and so insignificant, and it all came out with me punching and slapping him. His face. I haven't felt happy in this marriage for a while, but I love him and I do not want to hurt him. So why did I? How can I make sure I don't hurt anyone ever again? I apologized and meant it\nso much\n, but it's not at all enough.\nI can't move out because I don't have the money. Staying with friends would only be possible for a few days, and I feel so ashamed that my entire being is saying I'm just a burden - which makes asking for help even tougher. But I can't stay here and risk becoming so violent again. I scared myself. I'm really confused because while I feel so ashamed of myself, I also still feel angry. I'm typing this with cold hands. I just want to live in a place where I can turn the heat up to a comfortable level and trust that nobody will eat my leftovers. I want to be free. I don't want to be told my thoughts are stupid.\nI know I should go to therapy. Unfortunately, I have no money for that and insurance-covered therapy is incredibly hard to find. Even if I get a spot, there's bound to be a six-months wait. I don't know what to do. I already go to a free counseling session every three weeks or so, but that's just not enough. I have been depressed for a long time. I have ADHD (didn't take my meds for that the last couple of days, which is probably connected to the outburst?) and I'm burnt out. I really need help no longer being a person I look down on.\nAny thoughts would be appreciated, particularly if you have stories about people who used to be violent. I created an email address in case you'd like to answer anonymously:\n[email\u00a0protected]\nPlease, please be gentle.

Curious if this is offensive behavior on my part or not. Some examples below.\n1. A mutual friend (/my acquaintance) was coming over to hang out with partner. I had work with mutual-friend over the weekend and we chatted about their coming over (friend invited me to join them for beer at the beer-drinking part of their hangout, mainly out of politeness). I realized belatedly the next day that I had an appointment and asked partner to pass on my apologies and well wishes for something friend mentioned. Partner's mood turned sour and sarcastic and he refused, saying something along the lines of that's not his job and if I had something to say to someone I need to tell them myself.\n2. My work (a very small business) sometimes employs partner as a contractor. We do all the organizing in the business in a group chat, and otherwise the emails/admin person emails the contractors (all friends, casual to close). Sometimes if we're organizing something in the group chat involving partner, for example a meeting, they'll ask if I can ask partner if he's free at this time, since we're usually together and so things can be organized immediately. Partner absolutely hates the 'he-said-she-said thing', 'chinese whispers' and how we're 'always talking about other people as if they're not there' (as in, that they talk about him as a 3rd party when asking me to ask him, instead of addressing him directly if they have a question) and says if something involves him, admin person should ask him themselves. He thinks it's an extra level of communication for them to ask me to ask him; I think it's the same level of communication, since it's either me or the admin person asking him, and so I might as well since it's faster.\nHe says that I'm so used to it at my work I can't even see how wrong it is, and that he finds it alien and revolting. But I'm pretty sure being asked to pass along apologies/messages or ask someone something if they're with me is just something I've always done.\nPersonality-wise he's quite rigid about things and I'm fairly go-with-the-flow though so I'm not sure if this is actually something offensive that's passed me by that shouldn't have.\nSo what's normal here?\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(43 answers total)\n1 user marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"Person is asking whether their partner's refusal to pass along messages or accept passed messages is reasonable behavior, as the partner finds such indirect communication offensive and prefers direct contact.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_387766", "classification_type": "post"}}

We don't have kids.  Work is decent for both of us and we are middle aged.  Throughout most of our relationship we haven't done a ton of major travel.  Did Hawaii for our honeymoon and have done a bunch of shorter driving trips as well as visiting family a lot.  As of recently my wife is starting to take an interest in Disney cruises and international travel.  She's a die hard Disney fan with a season pass to Disneyland.  I am not into Disney unfortunately.  I don't hate it...I just don't love it enough to go there multiple times a year or take cruises all the time.   We did our 1st Disney cruise last year together.  It was ok.  My wife loved it...I didn't love it.  Didn't like the Disney aspect or the whole Cruise environment.  Of course during the cruise my wife had us put down a deposit on another cruise.\nEventually I told her I had no desire to go on the next cruise but said if we do one in the future to Alaska I'd be interested in that.  So she's going on a Disney cruise with a bunch of friends.  And that's great.  She'll have fun on the cruise, I'll have fun hanging at home and doing it up bachelor style.  I'm very introverted so for me that's a vacation, hahah.\nMy wife is now also thinking of taking a trip to Asia.  I hate flying, as I have a fear of flights.  And to make something pretty out in the open...I don't generally love taking big trips.  I just don't find it to be relaxing or enjoyable.  I find it to be stressful.  From the packing, making arangements for pets, making all the plans, to coming back and playing catchup.  Also the cost...we aren't poor but I think her opinion on taking these trips isn't considering the cost at least not in a serious way.\nAt the end of the day I want my wife to be happy.  She doesn't seem to have an issue with me not going on the next cruise.  Questions....Do I need to figure out a way to get myself to go on some of these cruises and trips...in effort to at least show her support with what she enjoys?  Is it fair to at some point say hey we need to find places and trips we both enjoy?  Is it also fair to say hey it's ok to take these trips whether together or alone but there needs to be a cap from a financial perspective?

Wondering if I'm actually not a good friend. I need some honest feedback on my behavior and maybe some advice for getting more organized. I'm too old to be this scattered :/\nYesterday was an old high school friend's birthday. She invited me, my partner, and one more friend to a waterpark. I agreed happily. While it was an hour away, I love my old friends and was sure it'd be fun. I asked my sister to check on the dogs and take them out midday. (I would not leave my dogs home alone for 11 hours, but knew they'd be fine for two stretches of five hours.)\nThe day was very fun for the most part, but I inconvenienced my friends in so many different ways, and I feel awful about it. Here's a complete list:\n- made them wait in the car for twentyfive minutes because I wasn't ready on time (we carpooled)\n- best friend used my bathroom while waiting, lots of dog hair on the floor and dishes in the bathtub\n- asked for a ten-minute detour to a store because I forgot my contacts (this might've been okay because both friends seemed happy to get snacks there)\n- slowest to shower pre-pool, they waited another five minutes or so\n- after first hour of swimming: AWOL for 30 minutes making calls because sister had overslept and I had to make arrangements to get her to my house quickly\n- texting sister between rides because I had left the wrong key, and she needed instructions for how to get in\nIn summary: I was in communication with my sister between 1:40 and 3:50, exchanging 44 short text messages and talking on the phone for a total of five minutes. Total pool time was from noon to seven. My friends did not even bring their phones to the pool. I felt strained and anxious between 2 and 4. I feel like I didn't bring my best self to this birthday party, and that I let my friends down. This feeling is exacerbated by the fact that I sent apologetic messages to both friends yesterday. While the birthday girl at least reacted with a heart emoji, my best friend did not react at all. This is scary. He's like a brother to me. I'm worried that he was shocked by the bathroom, or heard some pre-drive bickering between me and my partner, or just got so tired of waiting that he's really upset. Making people wait is probably my worst flaw. I asked him if he's okay just now. But I'm scared of his reply, and yes, I know I sound like a teenager.\n(I was already feeling fragile before all this because I had a first session with a potential new therapist the day before. He implied my depression is self-inflicted and activated my rejection sensitivity by saying it seems like I'm abdicating responsibility for taking care of myself, and that he does not want that burden. The unconditional love and acceptance my best friend usually provides is a strong antidote to the feeling of being a burden on the world, so these things seem connected in my mind.)\nposted by\nPurpleDragon\nto\nHuman Relations\n(29 answers total)\n3 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"friendship\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"The poster caused multiple inconveniences and delays during a friend's birthday outing and is worried they may have damaged their friendships, particularly concerned about their best friend's reaction.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_387468", "classification_type": "post"}}

I\nasked a question\nabout him here in 2012. We eventually broke up for good a few years after that. I have moved on, my life is so much happier, but I still carry a lot of unresolved rage from that time. It's only now, like this month, that I fully understand the pervasiveness of his emotional abuse. I'm wondering what to do about it, if anything.\nI was 20f and he was 26 when we met. I came from a strict, conservative minority background, he was my first boyfriend, a forbidden white guy. At the time we broke, up I felt like I was the bad guy. That I had myself become an abuser because I started weeping uncontrollably and blocking the door when he attempted to walk away from me during a fight. Because I smacked him on the arm once without much force, while he was yelling in my face. I instantly felt sick with guilt as soon as it happened, apologised repeatedly, and he never let me forget I was an abuser after that. I spent a long time after we broke up trying to work on myself, my \"craziness\".\nFor the past 5.5 years, I have been in a healthy relationship. I spent much of the first year hesitantly expressing myself. Asking, \"is that okay?\" before any action or idea. My current partner was mildly bemused and a touch concerned. I had an inkling at this time that what went wrong in my previous relationship wasn't all my fault. Some therapy helped me develop that perspective further. My viewpoint started to become more balanced and I developed a healthy anger at my ex.\nI'm now almost 40. It's only in the last couple of weeks that I've sat down to read 'Why Does He Do That?' by Lundy Bancroft. I had assumed it wouldn't really apply to me because I wasn't \"really abused\", he was just an asshole sometimes. But as I've read more and more of it, I've been feeling sick. My ex was never violent. He always framed his complaints as care and sensitivity. I was shocked to see so many of his behaviours and characteristics spelled out plainly as abuse. It's validating and relieving, but mostly I feel rage, expressed by wanting to burst into tears all the time.\nWhat really kills me is that I lost my friends because of him. We had a circle of close, mutual friends. Those friends did not take sides, we tried not to involve them, but a couple of years after we broke up I moved away from the city where they all still live, back to my home country. We kept in touch sporadically, a couple of them even came to stay with me, but once I started understanding what had happened, I felt like I couldn't be myself around them anymore. Even my ex himself! A few months after I moved home, I flew back to our shared city for a reunion, it was all jolly water-under-the-bridge vibes, he and I shared a nice chat and a hug. I was still so deluded at the time. I hate that he thinks I still have respect for him.\nI just disappeared from everyone's lives, stopped replying to messages. I didn't want to potentially ruin their friendships with my ex because he was always a wonderful friend to them, and I'm the one who's far away anyway. Why stir up drama? But I have hated feeling like the bad guy. They are good, smart, kind people who would have given me a fair hearing. But also, their bonds with him will only have deepened over the years, I assume. He was always a good, kind friend to them, the abuse was carefully hidden. It's quite possible, even, that he has told them I abused him, or would bring that out if I ever explained my side to them.\nSo I have been telling myself, these last couple of weeks, that the rage will subside. Let sleeping dogs lie, don't stir up trouble. I have this rage-driven urge to speak my truth. To email my three closest friends from that time and lay it out for them. How I feel now, why I left. Explaining how I don't need or expect anything from them in response. Which by now I don't, I truly believe. It would just feel so freeing to be truthful and open. But I get that it's a powder keg, I have no way of controlling the impact of my \"truth bomb\" (ugh I hate that phrase but it's apt).\nSo I'm telling myself not to rage and it's not working, because I still have these validation fantasies of speaking my truth. Please can you help me manage these feelings? How do I learn to live with the status quo?\nposted by\nguessthis\nto\nHuman Relations\n(11 answers total)\n8 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"m", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman who recently recognized her past 8-year relationship was emotionally abusive is struggling with unresolved rage and considering whether to reach out to mutual friends to explain why she disappeared from their lives after the breakup.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_386994", "classification_type": "post"}}

Despite her claim that she's not breaking up with me, I'm devastated. How should I get through this period of uncertainty?\nSome things I'm trying:\n- Talking with her honestly about how I'm feeling\n- Listening to her talk about how she's feeling\n- Meditation\n- Affirmations\n- Therapy\n- Exercise (though it's been tough as I'm not eating very much)\n- SSRIs (I've been struggling more and more with anxiety/depression, which has been a problem for our relationship)\n- Talking on the phone with friends\n- Distractions\n- Believing her when she says she loves me and is not breaking up with me\n- Couples counseling (starting next week)\nSome things that make it feel like a breakup:\n- She says she loves me but is not in love with me\n- She's not excited to make an effort to fall back in love with me\n- She says she doesn't feel like we understand each other and doesn't think we will understand one another\n- She doesn't think we're compatible\n- She thinks I've prioritized the relationship so much I've lost a sense of self\n- She feels like she hasn't been prioritizing me and doesn't want that to continue, but also doesn't want to start prioritizing me\n- She wants to do a lot of things I don't want to do (like go on a three-month trip) but doesn't feel it's fair to ask me to stay behind\nSome things I'm mad about:\n- She seemed disappointed that I reacted so strongly (I cried for about four days)\n- She thinks I'm hyper-fixated on us breaking up and I keep bringing it up because I'd rather break up than face change or some of the problems with our relationship/compatibility\n- Some of her behavior that seemed fine when I felt secure in the relationship now seems dismissive and disrespectful\nBecause this came on so suddenly for both of us, I'm trying to give her some time to figure out what she actually wants before forcing the issue. But I'm having a hard time believing that she's not breaking up with me (albeit slowly). And, frankly, after typing a lot of that out I'm having a hard time thinking that we shouldn't break up. Some of those things seem like dealbreakers.\nI haven't pushed to break up, though, because:\n- I'm still in love with her\n- We've treated each other really well over twelve years and made an amazing life together\n- Over the past week we've been more open and honest than we have been in a while, and that felt really good\n- I think it's worth going to couples therapy after 12 good years, a house we own together, and a dog\n- She says I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her and I feel the same about her\n- I'm not ready to lose her\nIn my better moments I feel like I'm getting back in touch with myself a little bit, finding some identity and self-love and self-support. I'm also deepening other connections and recognizing some unhealthy ways I've been retreating from the world. And I really do admire her honesty and want to give her the space to figure out what she really wants so we can come together and see if it matches up with what I really want.\nIn my worse moments I'm overwhelmed by sadness and despair and feel like I've lost my one chance to be happy in a relationship (or maybe at all).\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(23 answers total)\n1 user marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type ", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"male\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A man in his early 40s is dealing with uncertainty after his female partner of 12 years expressed doubts about their relationship and said she's unhappy with her life, though she claims she's not breaking up with him.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_386960", "classification_type": "post"}}

How can it work?\n\nBody:\nMy new partner and I have different conflict styles and I\u2019m finding it hard to navigate. I\u2019m conflict avoidant and cry easily, where he sees yelling as a natural way of expressing how one\u2019s feeling. I\u2019m working on being more emotionally resilient these last few years and have made fairly significant (to me) progress \u2013 I can take being screamed at fairly nonchalantly now for example - but struggle with it in a relationship context.\nHe's frustrated with:\n. My lack of emotional resilience \u2013 when voices are raised and (what I perceive as) contempt is shown I cry. Things that are barely disagreements to him I see as large conflicts \u2013 he thinks this is making mountains out of molehills\n. For him, the anger blows over and is finished. For me, the fight-or-flight chemicals/cortisol leave me drained and unhappy for a few hours until my body finishes processing\n. That after a rage, it seems to wipe out the good feelings he's built up with me and his progress is erased\n. He thinks my desire for every day to be happy and conflict-free is ridiculous, as conflict is a normal part of every day life\nOn my part I struggle with:\n. The way he talks to me when he\u2019s feeling raised emotions is so confronting to me \u2013 even at my angriest I've never come close to speaking to anyone like he does to me when he\u2019s mildly annoyed\n. I\u2019m wired to go out of my way to prevent \u2018bad\u2019 things from happening (I\u2019ll overthink all the things that could go wrong in a situation before it happens), so this new norm of constant conflict is miserable because I can\u2019t prevent them\n. It feels like I\u2019m struggling to get to the \u2018I love you\u2019 stage because I think I need a more constant uninterrupted happiness, and when I feel conflict I lock up inside to feel safe. Our sex life has been suffering as I don\u2019t feel sexual when I\u2019m in this state \u2013 I finish him every day/every other day but don\u2019t really want him to touch me\n. I also can\u2019t figure out how to have relationship conversations - he sees it/the way I do it as me starting drama and conflict\nCulturally I\u2019d say he is more high-conflict than the norm where we are. He\u2019s notorious in his line of work for yelling at people (for being what he thinks is lazy or not doing the right thing), and has been in trouble for it before. I occasionally have to mouth apologies to cashiers/baristas/service people as we leave due the way he spoke to them if they\u2019ve done something he deemed unacceptable (not knowing their product well enough, interrupting our conversation even if we\u2019re the ones in the wrong by standing in the way, being \u2018incompetent\u2019, etc). It surprised me when he said he\u2019d been asked to leave by a cafe staff once \u2013 I thought the number would be higher.\nExample of a conflict: I once left a spoon in the sink thinking I\u2019d wash it up with the dishes after dinner. He slammed a door and screamed at me for being thoughtless about a shared space \u2013 his expectation is that everything no matter how small is washed immediately after using/eating, ideally during cooking. He hadn\u2019t said so explicitly but felt I should have realised by observing him, as he had been thoughtfully doing for me.\nMore commonly something will trigger him and he\u2019ll stew in a quiet contemptuous rage for a few hours. I\u2019ll ask him if I\u2019ve done something to annoy him or make him mad, and to tell me please so I can fix it. He\u2019ll say that it\u2019s nothing/not a big deal and sometime after seemingly get over it when he\u2019s decided he\u2019s done being mad about it.\nI find it hard to figure out how to defuse these situations. He said there are three ways to get a guy to do what you want but that I don\u2019t know any of them. One of them is apparently that if he\u2019s yelling at me, don\u2019t engage; just look bored, raise an eyebrow and ask him pointedly if he\u2019s done - if not [I\u2019ll] be waiting here until he is. That would  take the wind out of his sails and he\u2019d stop yelling and start talking (though sometimes he wouldn\u2019t be done and will need to yell some more until he is). I\u2019d never encountered anyone who yells like he does so I couldn\u2019t have imagined that as a response \u2013 it seemed contemptuous and condescending to me, though he\u2019d probably prefer that to my people pleasing tendencies.\nTo his credit I can tell that while he\u2019s deeply annoyed by some things I do, he tries hard to let it go. He\u2019s said that he\u2019s felt a deep sense of anger towards the world since maybe 20 years ago, and it\u2019s clear he tries not to let the anger out.\nI guess I\u2019m looking for anecdotes, advice and resources on emotional resilience and finding a common ground.\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(83 answers total)\n8 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, ", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A conflict-avoidant person is struggling to navigate a relationship with a partner who uses yelling and confrontation as normal ways of expressing emotions, leading to communication breakdowns and intimacy issues.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_386562", "classification_type": "post"}}

Her needs for space then triggers a trauma response and I spiral as I try to fix it. She feels controlled and wants some time away from me.  I feel like a child. She feels unsafe, and I feel deep shame.  In those moments, I feel like I don't know her, I can see her eyes filled with fear that I am not respecting her boundaries, that she is afraid of me, and I feel existential dread.\nI want to stop this immediately. I know I want to be with her, and I know I am self sabotaging. She has pointed out to me how scary this is for her, and how it doesn't seem like I will ever understand. She is worried that this emotional behaviour will also lead to other boundary pushing on my part.   I know this stems from a scary first few years with my mother as child.\nIf you have encountered this in your partner, or have experienced it yourself, do you have advice how you dealt with it?\nposted by\nmiles1972\nto\nHuman Relations\n(12 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"Person struggles with controlling behavior in their romantic relationship, experiencing trauma responses when their partner needs space after conflicts, leading to a cycle of hurt and boundary violations.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_386491", "classification_type": "post"}}

(how) do i deal?\ni (nb, queer, as is everyone in this story) have been dating sam for six months after meeting though a mutual hobby. sam is wonderful and sweet and things are going very well. we are monogamous.\nwe both recently met joe though said mutual hobby. joe and sam connected, hung out together once while i was at work, and started texting/messaging. recently, a week or two into their friendship, sam told me that joe had invited us to a play party, phrasing it something like, i\u2019m not sure if you and anonymous are interested, but i can get you invites to this private play party i\u2019m going to. joe did say they invited another friend from our community, and sam pointed out that joe invited both of us, but to me it felt like the invitation was directed at sam, with me as a polite/necessary accessory. sam responded that they had been wanting to go to a play party but demurred. i told sam that joe's invitation made me uncomfortable, like joe was shooting his shot to see if sam would be interested in taking their relationship to a sexual space (literally and perhaps figuratively). sam had not previously told joe that they are interested in play parties, though they are (and have not been; i have, though only once).\njoe then invited sam/us to another play party, telling joe that they had invited another couple we know. i started to feel more uncomfortable, and sam told joe that though they are interested in play parties, they only want to go with me and don\u2019t want to go with anyone else they know. joe responded by saying, in part, i hope i didn\u2019t make you uncomfortable, i go to play parties with platonic friends all the time, i can see how you would think it was an attempt to hook up if you\u2019ve never been, etc\ni feel like this response was disingenuous and condescending. in my opinion, play parties are not spaces that you go to with just any friend, they are spaces you go to with friends you are comfortable/interested in viewing/participating in sexual content around/with.* if you go with a friend, maybe you\u2019d play together or maybe you wouldn\u2019t, but overall it\u2019s still a sexual space. and many friends do play with one another and consider it platonic.\nsam is very reassuring about the fact that they only want to be sexual with me, but i feel incredibly uncomfortable around joe, such that i am limiting my engagement in our hobby, which sucks. to me, joe seems like someone who shot their shot and is now being disingenuous about it, and i don\u2019t like that. i also don\u2019t like that sam doesn\u2019t see it that way (though they say they understand my perspective) and thinks joe is a really genuine person who wanted to pass along a cool invite. sam has been slowing down their contact with joe because of my discomfort but has been clear that they do want to be friends with joe.\ni have been learning to trust my intuition, which is often borne out to be prescient, and my hackles are seriously raised by joe in a very intense unpleasant ruminative way.** i feel uneasy imagining a future in which sam and joe are close. sam feels like the issue is that i don\u2019t trust them. my conscious reality is that i don\u2019t trust joe, but i do see that in order for something untoward to happen between joe and sam, sam would need to be a willing participant, so i suppose on some level i don\u2019t yet fully trust sam.\nso, mefi, am i just being super square and insecure and sex-negative? do i just need to get over this? if so, how? and/or are there boundaries i could set/requests i could make that would respect sam\u2019s autonomy and freedom but minimize my anxiety?***\nthank you!\n*i realize that for some people, this could be all of their friends, and perhaps herein lies the rub\n**i have an intake appointment with a psychiatrist next week to be evaluated for ocd\n***already in therapy\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(26 answers total)\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romant", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"non-binary\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A person is uncomfortable with their partner's new friendship because the friend has invited them to play parties, which they interpret as romantic/sexual interest in their partner.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_385880", "classification_type": "post"}}

Am I just projecting my own issues, or do other adult  children of addicts experience this too?\nI grew up with an alcoholic parent, in an extended family with an extensive history of addiction. I realise it's common for people from this background to be attracted/attractive to people with substance-use disorders (romantically or platonically), but that's not quite what I'm trying to describe. Periodically I'll encounter someone at work, socially, whatever, and within a couple interactions I can sense\nsomething\nthat reminds me powerfully, on a gut level, of my loved ones who are/have been addicts. As I get to know these people better they frequently turn out not to be in any kind of active addiction, but the gut feeling persists. (They also frequently seem to like me, even if I don't especially want to befriend them, but this could again be projection.)\nThis sensed similarity seems to manifest as a certain emotional intensity, maybe mixed with depressive or moody tendencies. But...a lot of other people are intense, or melancholy, or whatever, and they don't all set off this sense of recognition in me? Do any other family members of addicts experience this? If so, what do you think it is?\nI guess I'm asking this question because I'm trying to be a lot more mindful and proactive about how I choose and nurture my interpersonal relationships, and I'm wondering if I can really trust my ability to sort out natural affinity from the desire to repeat comforting but unhealthy patterns.

We did reach the point where we had a plan and I was interviewing for jobs in his city, but when push came to shove he panicked and broke up with me. He gave me a bunch of excuses including that I didn't clean the way he did and that I didn't eat pork which doesn't work for him cooking for two people long-term. Frustratingly, some of the stuff he raised, we actually resolved on the call, but it was too late now because instead of having a 'let's talk out these issues' talk, he went nuclear.\nThe last time I physically saw him two weeks ago, I had no indicated anything was wrong. He even gave me an engagement-style ring which he emphasised was a 'gift.' Family and friends asked if I was engaged because it was so striking.\nHe wants to remain friends but I don't think I can, at least not right now. I still love him so much. He said I was wonderful, the best relationship of his life and that he loved me. He also said he'd noticed some bad controlling habits cropping up that had arisen in his marriage and he didn't want to put me through that (yes, I had noticed this - but at least he was self-aware and you can do therapy in a relationship).\nOther things that happened to me in the last year:\n-My beloved cat of 19 years old died (had her since I was a kid).\n- My terminally ill relative died in January. I then had to wait a month for the funeral/was embroiled in funeral planning. We were very close.\n- The\nday\nI returned from compassionate leave my workplace told me they were letting me go. No issues had ever been raised in my frequent one to ones with the manager who had recently gone on maternity leave. It was a big shock as I've never been fired before.\n- My aunt died unexpectedly.\n- The break up.\n- The year before last, my good friend died from breast cancer.\nOne good thing\n- my first novel is supposed to be published next year, but now I'm nervous about that panning out too!And yes, the ex asked me to send a copy...\nI had the good sense to save up to 6 months of my salary, but once the end of summer comes I'll be in trouble. The job market is tough.\nThe last time, I saw my ex, I had the courage to tell him how I was feeling. How I was scared of not being able to pay bills. That I had lost the daily camaraderie of being with my team, and now I couldn't afford to see friends because that costs too. I told him I felt isolated and scared. He told me I shouldn't feel inadequate, that I'm enough. But after the break up he isn't exactly selling this.\nNow at 33 having to start over I'm also dealing with the reality I might not ever have kids - it won't mean life over, but I'd like to have the chance. In my 20s, I lived in a bunch countries. I came home to Scotland just before Covid hit and lots of good things happened - hell, 2023 was the best year of my life. But now I can't get enthused about anything or even about living here. How do I decide where to turn next, or how to start asking myself the necessary questions to reach a better life?\ntherapy isn't really an option right now, due to cost.\nposted by\nBuffySummers\nto\nHuman Relations\n(14 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n ", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A 33-year-old woman is dealing with a recent breakup from a serious relationship where her partner suddenly ended things despite previous plans and gift-giving, compounded by multiple losses and life challenges in the past year.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_385821", "classification_type": "post"}}

I become aggressive sometimes, and if someone said to me, \"Be quiet\nnow\n, unless you want me to flip out\", I would feel manipulated. At the same time, I thought he'd want to help me get better. I've learned skills that will reduce the severity of the attacks, but I'm not Gandhi. I can't (yet) use mindfulness practices while I'm being talked at. All sounds and sensations become grating. So I repeatedly asked for some quiet time to downregulate, and he responded since I'm the one with the problem, I need to solve it myself. It just feels really dismissive and not loving.\nLast night, he started filming me when I lost it, and it feels like he enjoys seeing me lose control.

I talked to my best friend and I've been browsing YouTube in bed with dogs around me. I took a shower and listened to loud, happy music. I cried a lot and shared my frustration. I still don't feel better. I think my therapist accidentally activated some major childhood trauma today, and my formerly successful skills are failing me.\nI've been attending a mental health programme with music therapy, dance, CBT, gym, and mindfulness classes five days a week. It's helping me fight depression and burnout. But today, my therapist said the team decided I'll be done in two weeks, not four. They said at the start (six weeks ago) that it's decided on a case-by-case basis, and it sounds like they think I just won't make more progress than I already have (they agree I've made progress up to now). But I feel abandoned, and it's the weekend now, and I'm really not okay. I feel like I did something wrong. I don't know what that might be though, because I'm definitely not disrupting the process or causing problems. I follow their advice when I can and I'm honest when I can't (for example, I can sense they want me to end my marriage, and that topic is just so overwhelming tp me). Up until yesterday, I felt like everything was fine. In fact, I've never felt more at-ease in a group setting. I was even allowing for the possibility that I'm valuable to the group and likeable.\nThe worst part is that no therapist or other staff member approached me after I got the news, even though I was obviously extremely upset (first tearing up constantly, eventually withdrawing). As a kid, I remember desperately needing someone to see my distress. The people at this clinic act like very good parents most of the time, caring and respectful of themselves and others. They usually approach people and offer a conversation or something soothing (like some lavender oil to smell or whatever). Today, I felt disliked and rejected. My favourite therapist wasn't in, and I hated the idea of everyone voting me off the island. Another patient had to talk me down, and that was awkward because I don't want to be a burden. And then everyone went home.\nI really need a hug, but I don't want to lean on my husband because I agree our relationship isn't healthy.

We are both early 30s.\nI am in a relationship with a man I adore. It has been different with him since day one and he feels like family. I\u2019ve felt consistently safe and loved in the face of a hard year. My elderly cat died (she loved him and gave her permission!), then my grandmother who was something between grandparent and parent died, and then I was  laid off the day I returned from compassionate leave.\nHe has been amazing through all of it. He is also a successful hard worker and a kind person - perhaps I should also mention he is high functioning. We have gone on several trips together that were fun and easy, and while working remotely I was able to be with him for weeks at a time. Being in each others space for prolonged periods has been very easy too. My parents also love him and that\u2019s a first with both!\nBut now I want more. We\u2019re long distance and roughly see each other every two weeks for 3-4 days. Leaving is getting harder. I miss him and companionship, and feel lonely. Furthermore, I haven\u2019t met his family. They live in another country but it\u2019s only a 1.5 hour flight.\nI find myself approaching a brick wall when I try to discuss the future. The first time I brought it up was 11 months in. This was too early for him and he said let\u2019s wait a few months.\nDuring a long weekend break last week I raised it again because now that I\u2019m on the job market again I said I\u2019d like to include his city in my search, otherwise we\u2019re staring at more years apart. He said he would be happy to take on most of the travelling to me if I end up in my own city again, but also looking in his city would be fine.\nAt this point, we have not solidly stated whether we want marriage and kids. I have always been on the fence, but I am moving in that direction the longer we are together. And I decided I\u2019d like to discuss this with him.\nFor the second time, he said he wanted to wait and have this conversation at a less stressful time in my life. He asked if this would be ok, I said no, it wouldn\u2019t, as he keeps pushing the conversation back. He talks about having kids often enough I didn\u2019t think it would be a leap to discuss it.\nUltimately, I was disappointed by his response. I suppose I wanted him to take my hand reassuringly and say he was ready now. Instead he said he loves me and spending time with me but that taking this next step would be serious and need a lot of conversation. He has been divorced before (she divorced him, the are still friends now). I am really bummed out that the thought of planning a future together didn\u2019t excite him.\nWe left it with him saying let\u2019s come up with a timeline when we see each other later this month but I do feel dejected.\nHow worried should I be at his reluctance to plan together in our early 30s a bit shy of 2 years in? And should I be handling these conversations differently? I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m strong arming someone into commitment.\nposted by\nBuffySummers\nto\nHuman Relations\n(34 answers total)\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman in her early 30s is frustrated that her boyfriend of nearly 2 years keeps postponing serious conversations about their future together, including marriage and children, despite their strong relationship.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_384748", "classification_type": "post"}}

I\u2019d like to do telehealth/Zoom consults, so they could be anywhere in the world.\nI have some pretty severe relationship anxiety, possibly relationship OCD (which is basically OCD, but where you obsess over whether your relationship is right for you). I tried seeing a marriage and relationship psychologist, but she just really didn\u2019t understand where I was coming from and hadn\u2019t actually heard of relationship OCD.

So, I'm not sure what to do next, but I feel like I would really benefit from someone who is a specialist in relationship indecision and anxiety and has kind of \"seen it all\" here.\nUnfortunately, my problem is just sufficiently weird that I don\u2019t think most therapists know what to say about it. I basically am in a happy long-term relationship, but have had off-and-on doubts which I can\u2019t resolve.

He\u2019s a straight cis man and I\u2019m a cis woman.\nAs well as having much in common, we both went through break ups and bereavements - I\u2019d say he was my closest confidante and his friendship helped me through these times.\nIn our twenties, we both moved to the same European country. I went first, he followed with his partner a few years later. We then spent one holiday a year together with partners and friends. But he became flaky and we argued more than once about him cancelling plans last minute.\nHe split up with his partner of a decade in 2023. He had also lost his aunt. I visited him for a few days. After this visit, I feel the ghosting started. I still heard from him at Christmas and New Year, but then nothing.\nFinally, in October I contacted him one more time saying I felt he was ghosting and I\u2019d like to address the issue if there was one. He replied saying he was upset that I\u2019d think he was ghosting. He said he had had a breakdown, had gone through treatment, and was doing much better.\nWhen I replied again, nothing. Three months later, he sent me a song about a woman with my eye colour saying \u2018This always reminds me of you\u2019. So I replied, and he sent a voice message back. He wanted to know how I was and to catch up.\nThe truth is that recent months have been very hard. I have been helping to care for a terminal relative. So I told him this, indicating she was in the last  days/weeks of her life. I then told him some more positive news and asked for his.\nSince then, he hasn\u2019t replied and my relative has since died. I acknowledge I\u2019m grieving but still I can\u2019t believe he couldn\u2019t even muster an \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 or anything sympathetic.\nI find the sensation of being demoted from close friend to acquaintance quite hard to take.

(Literally)\n\nBody:\nI would like to stop thinking about my ex, but\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\nmemory wipes aren't a real thing. What's the next best thing in the real world?\nI think about my ex every day, pretty consistently throughout the day. I wouldn't describe the experience as having intrusive thoughts, it's more like my brain \"defaults\" to it very easily. It's like there is a computer program dedicated to thinking about him running in the background at all times. The nature of the thoughts varies. Sometimes it's ruminating about confusing or painful things that remain unresolved for me with regard to our relationship. Sometimes it's replaying pleasant memories. Sometimes it's just a random neutral memory. Sometimes it's imagining how it would be to run into him on the street. There is no one consistent thing that my mind returns to -- it's more that overall, the volume is  A Lot. If the procedure in the\nEternal Sunshine\nmovie existed, I would opt for it with regard to him.\nI would like to stop thinking about him in the literal sense. I would like to develop an ability to, as it were, change the channel mentally when a thought of him arises. I know there are a number of CBT techniques that are useful for this sort of thing (interruption, redirection), but I would like further tips, ideally from your own experience, on concrete ways of using these strategies.\nA lot of the CBT worksheets and such I have looked at are largely focused on engaging with the content of the negative thoughts, whether thought challenging/reality testing, reframing, mindfulness, etc. I specifically don't want to engage with the content of my thoughts about my ex. I want the best strategies for redirection, ideally with an eye to, over time, minimizing how readily my mind reaches for this particular set of memories. For example, maybe you have dealt with something like this and found that redirecting to reciting poetry works well, or maybe visualizing some mental cue like, well, changing the channel.  Or hopping on one leg. Or some kind of effective negative conditioning (I have tried the rubber band on the wrist thing and it didn't really work). The more specific the better -- I would love to try different things and see if they work for me or can be adapted into something that works for me.\nI am not interested in advice on how else to approach or think about this predicament (so, please, no advice about therapy or suggestions along the lines of, if I resolve my feelings about him, the thoughts will attenuate organically).

I think my questions boil down to these: this is not great, right? and, also, is this happening more, or am I just noticing it more? And, also, maybe, what are folks thinking, if most of us (right?) know it's not great? I know sometimes it's financial, but also maybe they're caught up in new relationship energy? (I hope this isn't chatfilter.)\nThe situations I'm describing involve monogamous people and both gay and straight couples.\nA college friend of mine (we are both middle aged) had essentially an emotional affair with a coworker on and off over a few years, including a stint where he and his wife broke up for a month and he dated the other person then (so, an actual, very brief, sexual relationship). He and his wife finally decided to divorce, and he moved out of the family home and moved right in with his new partner. The kids are teens.\nAnother friend told me about a same-sex couple she knows where they were together many years, have kids, and, as they are moving out from each other, both are about to start cohabitating with new partners. The kids are in middle school and high school.\nYet another friend told me that, fresh on the heels of her divorce and coming out, she moved in really quickly with a new partner, and the relationship crashed and burn, and it was super disruptive for her kids, and she regrets that.\nI get that, after a long and unhappy relationship, new love can feel so surprising and intoxicating that it's hard to believe it's not eternal, and people sometimes make rash decisions. I also know there can be real financial and logistical benefits to a household with two adults. But, I'd also think in many of these cases, these are folks who want to do right by their kids and aren't necessarily responding only to financial pressure. I am wondering why people are doing this when it's so against the conventional wisdom (isn't it?). I wonder if it's because parents feel pressure to live with a partner instead of having someone over when the kids are in the house? Like, does that make the relationship seem more legitimate?\n(I also want to be clear that I know this is none of my business, and I am definitely not sharing my opinions with any of the people I am talking about.

I have said no once in 11 years.\nSister starts to berate me that Nephew is only a boy staying in a room at my house that I don\u2019t even need to speak to him and that Nephew is picking up on me being disgruntled, that she needs to work, that the government says she has to work, that she is a single mother etc. etc. Nephew comes down the stairs. It\u2019s ok Nephew she says, see what I mean about Aunty, she is horrible. They leave and Sister slams the door behind her.\nTwo weeks later.

This is the first time I have been the one to break up a serious relationship.\nSince then I have really struggled to stop ruminating over this decision. I still go to bed at night trying to soothe myself by remembering all the specific times the relationship felt wrong and still sometimes worry whether I self-sabotaged or just didn\u2019t try hard enough. I feel like I\u2019m stuck in this weird limbo between believing the breakup was the right thing to do, yet still not believing anything will ever match up again. I\u2019m worried there is something fundamentally flawed with me which means I can\u2019t just appreciate a good, healthy partnership. I often look around at other people and wonder why it seems so easy and natural for them.\nI\u2019ve been on a number of dates since the breakup, many of them pleasant, but none have progressed. Part of the reason for this is that I\u2019m being super aggressive with cutting things after the first or second date if I\u2019m not feeling a vibe. I think I\u2019m terrified of ending up in another situation where I\u2019ve overlooked issues at the beginning and then realised down the track that those issues meant the relationship couldn\u2019t survive (I\u2019m 32F).\nI have been to some therapy sessions but would appreciate any input from anyone who\u2019s been in a similar situation, found a way to stop this relentless rumination and/or found a good way to approach finding a new partner without comparison to their ex.\nposted by\nneverforget88\nto\nHuman Relations\n(5 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman broke up with her partner a year ago due to lack of romantic feelings and is struggling with rumination, regret, and difficulty moving forward in dating new people.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_382945", "classification_type": "post"}}

I am mostly looking for validation, because I've starting to feel like he is gaslighting me in some ways lately. Basically, if you've been the betrayed partner of a couple and your partner wanted to stay friends with the affair partner, what did you do? What did you say to express your desire to, say, have your partner go no-contact with their affair partner?\nI don't think I will ever budge from this boundary, and it is incredibly frustrating that R doesn't (or claims not to) understand it.

None of the accusations are true and are not really based in reality. Could this get better?\nMy husband has been seeing a therapist who specialises in narcissistic abuse since spring of this year, following a set of realisations about past relationships and then decisions to cut contact with his best friend, his parents, and finally his only sibling. He tells me his therapist has tentatively suggested he may have cPTSD. Before he started therapy, he would in effect try to use me as his therapist and I have listened to him talk for many, many hours. I am sad that he has so few people in his life now but consider that he is better placed than I am to decide on the kind of relationships he should have with his family and friends.\nMy husband has also experienced IBS-related agoraphobia for about 8 years rarely leaving the house, and is entirely dependent on me financially. He came out to me, and my friends and family as bisexual early in the year. He is not engaging in any medical care except for his weekly therapist appointment on Zoom. We have sex very infrequently (and this is a mismatch for him) but otherwise have a very affectionate and loving relationship. He has always been supportive of me and been proud of my accomplishments inside and outside work. Before these very occasional accusations started happening, I felt generally like the character in\nAlanis Morrissette\u2019s Head over Feet\n.\nHe clearly has symptoms of anxiety including physical symptoms such as feeling dizzy and sometimes expresses paranoid thoughts about eg tradespeople that come to the house. Very occasionally he is angry at me. Sometimes this will be with a raised voice, other times with what feels to me like quite cold-blooded venom, sometimes it will be preceded by an obvious short period of silent treatment. It is always a long, confusing monologue, with vague insinuations and an insistence that I know exactly what he is talking about. He frequently claims that people say things \u2018subtextually\u2019 and sometimes specifically that I have clearly communicated something related to his insinuations \u2018subtextually\u2019. Although I have never felt at risk of violence, when this anger happens I feel very physically frightened. I tend to remain silent, and my thoughts are focused on escape and the risks of escalation. I find his train of thought very difficult to follow, it is not concrete or specific and I am sometimes in panic mode. I am often very literal and am not sure that I really know what he means when he talks about things being \u2018subtextual\u2019. Eventually he will make a specific accusation, or I will say something and that will lead to an accusation.\nThe accusations so far have been\n\u2022\tI am withholding sex deliberately to manipulate him\n\u2022\tI lack empathy and am manipulative\n\u2022\tI treat him badly in general and would be unhappy if he was no longer agoraphobic\n\u2022\tI have been having casual relationships with other people since we met 12 years ago\n\u2022\tI have at some point had a \u2018secret relationship\u2019 with a particular female friend.\nThe accusations are both unexpected and untrue.\nAfter I have denied the accusation, eventually the anger will blow out and dissipate. There might follow another confusing monologue about his state of mind and the trauma he has experienced. Usually, we will then have a decent conversation (either immediately or the next morning) in which he provides some reasoning behind his accusation. They are generally based on very convoluted trains of logic and some snippet of a real-life event or comment. He interprets his accusations and my denials as a way of providing reassurance that I am not going to cause trauma like \u2018everyone else\u2019 has. He has some real sympathy for my being upset by them, but I am not convinced he understands how much they distress me. He has told me that wants me to have more empathy for his trauma and accept that he does not mean the accusations personally.\nI find each anger and accusation event frightening at the time and destabilising afterwards. They have happened four or five times in this calendar year. Although I love him very much, I think that if they kept continuing, I would eventually want to leave. I am holding out hope that by continuing to work with his therapist they will stop at some point. Am I being wildly unrealistic? I recognise that I have a strong reaction to any anger. Is there anything I could do to reduce the impact it has on me in the meantime?\nI unsuccessfully tried to persuade him to go to therapy for a very long time, and in the end, it was a friend of mine who convinced him, so my chances of talking him into any specific actions are low. But if he were asking for advice, what advice would you give?\nIn terms of my own real-life support, I", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman is seeking advice about her husband's paranoid anxiety and trauma-related accusations against her, wondering if his condition might improve with continued therapy and how she can cope with the distressing episodes.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_382776", "classification_type": "post"}}

It is not for lack of meeting people, however! A few times in recent months I have met someone, really enjoyed talking to them, and spent the better part of the day or night together with (I think!) a clear mutual interest. However, it always falls apart after that and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. For context I am a straight dude.\nFor example, last week I met someone getting breakfast who was super nice and I really enjoyed chatting with her. I had to go about my day but before I left she asked for my number. We met later the same day and originally planned to only say hi but ended up talking for a few hours before finally going home for the evening. I texted her later that night, she responded right away, and we talked a bit more before I asked if she would like to get coffee in a few days. After that, radio silence and I am not sure how or if to follow up.\nIf this was a one time thing I would not think anything of it but a couple similar situations combined with this one have left me wondering what is going wrong? I can't help but to think that something about myself is putting people off, but I always feel like we have a really nice time in person when we meet, and then afterwards we aren't on the same page at all. Curious to know if other people have experienced this. I am doing fine and not even really searching for a relationship but it is really bugging me that these great people I meet (and think I connect very well with) rarely want to follow up.\nThanks!\nposted by\nMtRChem\nto\nHuman Relations\n(24 answers total)\n6 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"male\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A man who moved to a new city has good initial meetings with women but struggles when they lose interest after he suggests follow-up dates, despite seemingly positive interactions.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_382484", "classification_type": "post"}}

He originally went to a university for engineering just like his older sister did but couldn\u2019t pass the math classes, but got into the party scene, got arrested a few times, his Facebook is full of posts from long ago about getting and being drunk and \u201clet\u2019s fuck shit up!!!\u201d type of posts. He even has a couple posts about wrecking his truck drunk driving. He got kicked out of his fraternity when he got arrested, couldn\u2019t pass classes, switched his major several times, dropped out, moved back to the farm, then went to community college and got his AA just so he could say he finished something. He had at least 84k in private student loans, but paid off 30k in 5 or so years, now at 54k. He has lived with his family since he came back from university in 2011. He makes 54k as an apprentice ironworker (he is one year in) and should make $36/hr in two years. However he did waver getting into iron, and he has considered another job offer recently at his old mechanic job, so he does not seem that committed or happy as the work is very tough and commute can be long, and also he smokes weed he says only on special occasions although he gets randomly drug tested at work, which I believe could cost him his job. I think he said he had $54k in retirement as I thought he said he broke even with his debt. He currently pays $1.2k on his student loans monthly, he told me recently. I knew he had student debt but he just told me how much recently.\nHe still sleeps on his old futon from college in his dad\u2019s unfinished basement. Their home is neglected and not clean. Unfinished projects and cracked walls and cabinet doors missing and expired food. His mom is really mentally ill and recently divorced the dad a few months ago. No one in the family likes her and they idolize their dad who is a very sweet man and good man but also makes questionable decisions, and also there\u2019s a lot of beer cans around and I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s all drinking the beer, maybe he drinks a lot I\u2019m not sure, I think all of them do (boyfriend, lil brother, and dad). I know my boyfriend\u2019s brother said about my boyfriend, \u201cwhen are you not drinking?\u201d And boyfriend looked to me nervously and quickly to see my reaction. He told me before he doesn\u2019t drink much though. He doesn\u2019t at my house, he usually comes over and spends the night on Saturdays and stay until Sunday evening.\nWe planned to move in together in a couple of months, my mom encouraged me to ask him, with me moving out to him possibly renting an apartment (my choice) or house (he would like 2-3 bedrooms and a garage he said at first, but then said later after looking he could do an apartment) he lives an hour away in the country. Although there is really like no places for rent out there. He said he could do up to 30 minutes south of him which is in the middle of us but wants to be 10-15 minutes from the farm. He could transfer to the union in my city with the best jobs but doesn\u2019t want to. His friends live north of him which I suspect may be a reason, he knew two guys in iron in the union ", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A 31-year-old woman is considering whether to move in with her boyfriend of 2.5 years or break up and move in with her dad instead, due to concerns about their combined financial struggles and lifestyle compatibility.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_382313", "classification_type": "post"}}

When I ask my romantic partners to do something that would make me feel cared for, the act of me asking for it negates any special feelings from them doing it. It then doesn't feel like they're doing it because they care, they're doing it because I asked them to. But they're obviously doing it because they care and want me to be happy. How do I solve this in my brain? (examples inside)\nExamples.\n. I ask them about their day/how they're going/what do they have on today/so on. They rarely do the same, even if I give them positive feedback after they do it. After a clearer conversation, they put a reminder in their phone to ask me what I'm up to every day. It doesn't feel good when they ask because it doesn't feel like they genuinely care, they just ask because I wanted them to\n. I express that I'm hurt that partner isn't curious about me and doesn't know basic facts about me, they apologize and ask me the questions I raised as examples. It feels like the important part to me is their taking the initiative and without that the gesture feels empty.\n. I hint that I always did X-activity with past partners and that it's special to me in relationships specifically when I'm asked to do this with them (rather than the other way round). Partner took a while to come around to it and took a bit of convincing because in their previous relationship, that was a friend-only activity and their partner was hostile to it. When they finally started doing it with me, even though they asked me to do it often, it didn't ever feel great doing it because it felt like, despite reassurances, that they're asking me as part of being a Good Partner rather than because they enjoy it with me.\nSo on.

I emphasized that honesty was very important in the beginning of our relationship, and now I don\u2019t know where to go next, and how big of a deal this is in relationships.\nMy partner (M, 40s) and I have been together for around 5 years. In the early days of dating, I emphasized to him that honesty is very important to me, and we also talked about various viewpoints and boundaries. One of the topics that came up was around porn usage. I tried to approach it from a flexible and positive stance (learned from previous relationships about communicating in a more open way around sensitive topics, and tried extra hard to apply that here), that I understood most people watch porn and there\u2019s varying views around it, that my personal preference/boundaries was to not have porn usage in a relationship, and wanted to know what his views were. He had watched porn quite a lot throughout his life, but he said it was fine with him and agreed/promised he would no longer watch it. I said if something ever comes up in the future and he feels like it\u2019s an issue, to please tell me and we can talk about it and maybe we can adjust instead of hiding it etc.\nThings were mostly fine for a few years but recently there was an incident where I realized he had lied/omitted the truth. There\u2019s this social media channel he\u2019s always followed. They\u2019re borderline explicit, but mostly a comedy channel. Though their content is mostly sexual humor (since their popularity with their users and income is mostly from the sexual stuff around the female cast), just borderline enough to not get banned. It bothered me a bit in the beginning but my partner said he just watches it because it\u2019s funny, so I didn\u2019t mind too much. Recently, I randomly read up that one of the social media channels I watch was talking about how much money they make (surprisingly a lot), so I was curious about other channels and just googled the ones I knew about (a few of mine and a few of his). In one of the reddit threads about how much the comedy channel makes, there were a ton of comments that were just dudes asking for more explicit content from the female cast, saying they would pay even more for it etc. (the main discussion was also someone curious how much the channel makes, and then went into how the sexual content boosts their earnings). I remembered my partner said he is a tiered subscriber and actually pays money each month, but he had said it was just that he wanted to support creators that he likes. I felt a little uneasy about the reddit comments, so I asked him if there was any inappropriate content for paid subscribers (since the thread mentioned paid ones get special access to certain videos). He said no it\u2019s just bloopers and funny things like that and brushed it off. But the way he said it sounded weird. So I ended up looking up online (pretty easy to find) what the special videos were, and turns out it was actually more explicit stuff like the women play games and strip down to their underwear, or things related to sex toys etc. I confronted him, and he admitted he did lie. We had a big argument and I told him if he was lying about anything else it would eventually come out, and whether he had been watching porn. He then finally admitted that yes he had also been watching porn (but he said only a few times a year for stress relief).\nAfterwards, he did seem very remorseful, and tried to proactively repair things, but I\u2019m finding it hard to see him and the relationship the same way again. He did say he has issues with communication and talking about things, which I can see from the times I met his family - they pretty much don\u2019t even ask or communicate about normal things like \u201cso how many times do you want to come for dinner when you\u2019re visiting our city\u201d etc and everyone just makes weird assumptions and then gets resentful. He always had a lot of trouble talking about sex and more recently mentioned there was some shame around masturbation etc growing up. The next day he proactively said he had unsubscribed from the channel and wouldn\u2019t watch it again, and since we had talked about therapy before he said he wanted to try getting therapy to find out why he lied and how to work on fixing that.\nThough the porn itself wouldn\u2019t normally bother me that much and is more a secondary concern (if at all by itself), there\u2019s another factor that is relevant in that we haven\u2019t had PIV sex in the whole 5 years we\u2019ve been dating. We\u2019ve done other things, but without getting into detail (mechanical), we\u2019ve never been able to have PIV sex.

I feel like the relationship was more balanced, but the last few years have become very one-sided. Husband thinks it's always been one-sided. I am thinking we are both right, but I am guessing I used to assert myself into the conversation. I am growing so tired of this unbalanced friendship. In all fairness, when I/we do push and share they sincerely do care but I am flabbergasted that they never would have asked. And this is proven, if we don't shove our way into the conversation and assert ourselves they will not inquire. Naturally we don't hang out with them nearly as much as we used to, maybe every other month and that feels like a lot.\nI've been thinking about this more because I have a trip coming up with Sandy. Our kids are very very good friends and for a long time the kids (age 16) have wanted to do a special trip. Normally this would be something I would be excited for but now I am wondering how should I prepare? I don't want some friendship showdown on this trip and I also even wonder if people can change-so MeFi, what do you say? I hate confrontation but if you say it's time for a pow wow then fine. If you say it's time for slow fade, fine. Time for polite-neutral-whatever time, fine. In the times immediately afterwards our get-togethers I think there must be something I can say, not too rude-but a little pointed that might make them realize how beastly they are? When we go out Husband and I play off of each other and give prompts like we are in some terrible skit. It's just ridiculous.\nOn review, I am looking for advice of kind MeFis who have had similar experience and how I can gage my expectations on this. I swear I used to feel close to these guys and now I just don't even know what to do with them. They don't feel like friends at all.\nI have other things I want to talk about but I worry it would cloud the replies and everyone will be like DTMFs but I want to keep it at this core issue because I have experienced it with other friends and it leaves me completely stumped.

(more inside)\n\nBody:\nHi, thank you guys for everything. I'm having some trouble with my personal relationship and where responsibility lies for certain things. Putting details and some history below (potentially NSFW), and thank you guys so much for everything.\nHe wants to be more submissive, he has a lot of fetishes, and I've always been willing to commit to these things, even if they weren't necessarily things that I wanted. But sometimes when I bring up things that he has told me he wants, mostly to make him happy, he freaks out. He freaks out often when I bring up anything sexual, even though he is perfectly content initiating things. But if I initiate things, it's as if I'm a complete crazy person, and it makes me feel bad. I recognize that my trauma plays a certain part in things (I've been raped and assaulted once walking down the street in broad daylight), but I feel like he's never willing to recognize his own part in this, his own repression and shame around sexuality, his own denialism, his own defensiveness. It always falls to me to apologize for anything sexually upsetting that happens to him because otherwise it feels like our entire relationship is going to fall apart and he is willing to completely break up with me unless I take complete responsibility for our sexual troubles. It's very personally upsetting. Even if I'm trying to do everything he ostensibly wants.\nIt's embarrassing. We've known each other for over 20 years, we went to the same Christian high school together. His father was the pastor of the church that the school was connected to and his mom was an English teacher there, and then later the headmistress of the school. They were one of the most prestigious families in the small town we grew up in, whereas my family was very poor and abusive. I'm trying to work through this in therapy.\nI grew up having to homeschool most of my younger siblings and I didn't have a lot of social interactions growing up, although my family was much more secular. I met X when I was finally allowed to attend school at the age of 17.\nWe were friends the entire time, but four years before covid we finally started dating and it's always been complicated. We started dating right before Valentine's Day 2020, when he brought me a small cactus but then told me that we couldn't spend time together that day because he had already made plans to go see the theater with his mother. I only feel like this is relevant because of how his background has impacted his future view of relationships and sexuality. It really feels like he truly blows up whenever I bring up anything sexual, which feels restrictive and it makes me feel bad.\nHe had a strict upbringing and was shamed about sex at every turn, but I feel like he is in denial and defensive about how this guilt has affected our intimacy. He blames me a lot of the time. Sometimes I feel gaslit because he will tend to bring up my past sexual trauma in conversations in terms of how we've fought about sex, and how my trauma is responsible for our fights, and I feel like so much of the conversations about trauma are just a way for him to deflect, for him to feel better about his place in this, instead of addressing real issues regarding his repression and defensiveness.\nI would hope that someone could give me some insight or guidance or anything about this? I truly feel lost. To paraphrase Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, perhaps, when things are good between us, they are very very good, but when things are bad, they are horrid. And he truly is a good person, but I think in terms of his own sexuality, he is lost. I'm tired of this being an issue in our relationship, I'm tired of this being my fault, and I'm tired of the burden of it falling on me, or that I have to always take full responsibility for it. I'm tired of everything feeling like it's all my fault. I would really appreciate any guidance on this if you have any to offer.\nI'm not perfect in all of this, obviously, because there have been times where we've tried to discuss this and I feel like I've just gotten so frustrated and angry that I've started getting truly upset and, in his words, yelling, which I definitely don't want to do. I personally don't feel like I've yelled, but he can't handle anyone raising their voice even slightly or expressing any anger at all. Expressing anger around him is the ultimate turnoff, even though he feels allowed to do it occasionally.\nI'm in therapy, but this still puzzles me. I know that I might have not expressed this clearly, but I would so truly appreciate any advice or guidance or insight that anyone has about this. Thank you so much, truly.\nposted by\nHat Creek\nto\nHuman Relations\n(18 answers total)\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking fo", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman is experiencing sexual compatibility issues with her boyfriend, where he has specific fetishes and desires but becomes defensive and blames her when she tries to initiate or discuss sexual topics, leading to ongoing conflict and her feeling responsible for all their relationship problems.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_381704", "classification_type": "post"}}

I am, for the most part, very capable of handling my emotions. I can stay calm \u2014 to the point of detachment \u2014 in the face of most situations. However, in one very specific situation I struggle with my fight/flight/freeze/fawn response, and I'd like to manage it better.\nThere are one or two specific people in my life (being deliberately vague here) who, when they get angry, I feel the need to placate. In the cases where their anger is not directed at me, this is because I just don't enjoy being in the room with someone who's in a rage. In the cases where the anger\nis\ndirected at me (and let's assume I did something which would warrant that anger for the sake of this thread) this is because I just don't like certain people being angry with me.\nIt's probably worth noting that for people who are outside of this very small circle, I don't really give a toss if they display anger, and will simply walk away from any confrontation in order to give myself and them a chance to cool down.\nI've been through Gottman-method therapy before, where the term \"flooding\" was talked about a lot. This is a pretty apt description of what happens when one of these few people is angry with me. I may become defensive, and fight back, or I may simply go very very quiet (a freeze response) until they've stopped expressing their anger (which can take some time) or I will simply try to agree with everything they've said, apologise, and hope that I'll find the magic words which will calm them down (fawning).\nI often would like to walk away in these circumstances but it's not always possible without causing a further rupture \u2014 in all cases, my walking away would be greeted with a fairly disdainful \"of course you get to walk away, it's what you always do.\" Or a \"fine, whatever.\" Or, on occasion, a \"don't even bother coming back\" (or similar). I still will walk away sometimes, because\nI\nneed to regroup and calm down (my being angry serves little to no purpose, and just prevents me from communicating effectively), but I don't always know how long to walk away\nfor\n(my recovery time from anger is shorter than others', so I don't know if the argument might start again if I go back too early).\nI would like to find healthy ways of either a) de-escalating these situations (Gottman talks about \"the stress-reducing conversation\" but that's not helpful whilst tempers are flaring), and managing that flight/fight/fawn/freeze response so that I am calmly able to say \"I'm going to step away to calm down\" without feeling like I'm just taking a few steps back from the edge of the crater whilst leaving the volcano to keep on bubbling.\nFor the purposes of this discussion you can assume these people are family, and that ending those relationships isn't a realistic option. I am in therapy, but I'm dealing with other things there.\nHow did you learn to manage these kinds of situations? How do you maintain zen-like calm in the face of somone else's anger or, occasionally, rage?\nposted by\ngmb\nto\nHuman Relations\n(10 answers total)\n10 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"male\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"family\",\n  \"relationship_situation_summary\": \"A 43-year-old man struggles with managing his fight/flight/freeze/fawn responses when specific family members become angry, seeking advice on how to stay calm and de-escalate situations without damaging relationships.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_381554", "classification_type": "post"}}

I can't even spray them down because the hose is also in the backyard.\nOur long-term relationship to the landlord is irrevocably damaged, so not relevant. We are already searching for a new place with all our energy. We were actually asked to leave a few months ago, but haven't been able to find a new apartment yet because of a housing crisis. The law around here provides some protection in that we can't physically be evicted until/unless a judge says so. The landlord is trying to make that happen, but it will take a few more months at least. Meanwhile, we really are stuck here until someone else lets us move in. And this guy\ndefinitely\nwants us gone ASAP. He wants his son to have our apartment, and I believe he's very frustrated that his family is seeing him in a temporarily \"powerless\" position.\nPlease assume that we are doing everything we can for the apartment search and do not have the option of moving in with anyone outside of an actual emergency. We're being extremely quiet and basically invisible, certainly not going around taunting the guy in any way. We had a good relationship until Christmas, when water damage and the termination of our contract caused a rift. Things have been deteriorating ever since.\nOur lawyer says that we can't legally be banned from the backyard because use of the orchard, vegetable patch, etc. is specified in our contract. Letting the dogs play in the lake is not mentioned there, but he doesn't think we could get in legal trouble from letting them swim as they've done so regularly over the last two years (with explicit permission). They're not causing damage and that hasn't been asserted by the landlord, either. The other dog in the house, who belongs to the landlord's son, still swims occasionally and all three dogs happily swam together until just a couple weeks ago.\nHowever, the lawyer believes we should give in and abide by the new rules regardless. He thinks it's unwise to antagonize a choleric person (his words), and he also believes that compliance might favourably influence the judge if we do end up in court. I sort of feel like I'd rather take on any consequences myself, if that can shield the perfectly innocent animals from this person. Then again, going against a trusted lawyer's advice doesn't sound smart.\nI'm not worried about physical violence (Landlord's almost 70 and there's always other people around. Guns are highly controlled here). I believe the worst he'd ever do to me is yell.\nWhat would you do?\nposted by\ntoucan\nto\nHuman Relations\n(39 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidenc", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"other\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A tenant is seeking advice on how to deal with an angry landlord who has banned their dogs from using a shared lake on the property as retaliation, while they are stuck in the rental during a housing crisis and pending eviction proceedings.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_381366", "classification_type": "post"}}

My marriage had been full of anger and yelling, and I felt relief that it was over. I started thinking about dating again and finding a relationship, at least a casual one.\nI met someone. The paths of our lives crossed, and I asked her out after a few weeks of knowing her. A couple of months later we had fallen in love. She hadn\u2019t been with anyone since her own unhappy marriage ended 10 years previous and didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever feel comfortable trusting a man again.\nWe embarked upon a fulfilling relationship. We don\u2019t live together but are committed. We spend nights together two or three times a week and text frequently.\nShe is European and arrived in the US on a one-year work visa. She decided to come for new experiences and the opportunity to live elsewhere. Because of our relationship and because she generally likes her life here (but not her job), she decided to renew her contract for a second year and now a third. The third year begins once she gets back from her summer holiday in Europe. But she won\u2019t be able to renew again.  Three years is the limit, and she will have to leave.\nI\u2019m posting because I would like insight into two questions I have. First, how should I think about this final year?\nI want us to enjoy our time together. I don\u2019t want it to be overshadowed by the sadness of breaking up and a clock ticking down. We don\u2019t really talk much about our impending separation. It\u2019s not a fun topic of conversation, and what\u2019s there to say anyway? At the same time, it\u2019s an elephant in the room, and it needs to be addressed in some way. But I don\u2019t know how. I want to find a mindset of equanimity about it, to be able to reassure my girlfriend and myself. I don\u2019t know what that mindset would look like.\nAnd then, what should happen to our relationship once she departs?\nWill it just end, and then we never see each other again? That doesn\u2019t seem right. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want to have an international long-distance relationship with no reunion in sight. Sure, we could travel abroad to see each other, but it would be for short trips and not often. Neither of us has the money or time for frequent international travel. It wouldn\u2019t be enough to sustain our relationship.\nWould we keep up by sending WhatsApp messages to each other until our presence in each other\u2019s lives faded? Or wouldn\u2019t it be better to end things cleanly so we can mourn and move on? But I\u2019d miss her if I\u2019d never heard from her again. I\u2019d like to know how she\u2019s doing. Maybe far in the future, we could reunite somehow? That would be a long time away, if ever. I wouldn\u2019t want to put my life on hold. And I don\u2019t think either of us would want to hear about any new romances.\nIt\u2019s not possible for me to live in her country. I have my two kids   to raise. I wouldn\u2019t want to uproot them, and I have shared custody. Also, my job is in person.\nMarriage would solve visa issues for her to stay in the US and find other work, but my divorce was just finalized a few months ago. I don\u2019t want to get remarried, at least no time soon. Besides, she wouldn\u2019t want to live in the US permanently. She has adult children back home to whom she\u2019s quite close, has friends and other family, as well as a house.\nAgain, my questions are what would be an ideal attitude to have for this upcoming year together, and what should our breakup look like?\nposted by\nLeontine\nto\nHuman Relations\n(20 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advic", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"male\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A man is seeking advice on how to handle the final year of his relationship with his European girlfriend who must leave the US due to visa restrictions, and how they should approach their inevitable breakup.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_381076", "classification_type": "post"}}

More snowflakes inside.\nI lived in a houseshare for a couple of years. Things were really nice for a long time - fun group activities, shared meals, jamming on the guitar together, evening meditations.\nThen I became involved romantically with one of the housemates, V. She made a move on me and I fell for her, hard. Housemate R wasted no time in being outraged, telling me what a piece of shit I was for sleeping with a housemate, how it was going to destroy the houseshare which she relies upon (she has a long-standing leg injury making her much less mobile than most). V got wind of this and was upset, broke things off with me. To my shame I didn't push back.\nWhen V subsequently and abruptly decided to move out to go travelling (we had since gotten back together), R was suddenly all smiles, saying 'now that V's moving out you should follow your heart! (and maybe you dating her will make her stay, haha).' V left shortly after, and I was totally heartbroken.\nMany months later I got an apology for it all, with R saying that she wasn't malicious but hadn't acted with my happiness in mind, that she was bitter that I was dating someone younger than her and had lashed out because of her own difficulties with dating. I accepted the apology but never really forgave her.\nRecently, another housemate, H, who is a close friend of mine, told me that R had read my diary. I suggested maybe it was a good thing for her to know how upset and angry I was at what happened. \"No, it was pretty bad,\" he said, and referenced two particular things I had written about her which I guess she took to heart. I re-read the journal: those two things are separated by 150 pages. So I guess she just read the whole thing, and then discussed it at some length with H, who also asked if there was anything in there about him.\nThat journal has everything in it - therapy notes, medical issues, drug experiences, dates, sex, work, body image, family stuff, everything. The idea that she just read the thing cover to cover and then casually discussed its contents makes me feel sick with anger.\nH then told me that R has been \"giving herself a discount on her room\". Somehow the monthly rent for the house in the contract we signed was less than the sum of the room rents we each paid. For convenience we paid into her account and she paid the landlord. Instead of telling us we were overpaying, she just pocketed the difference. Based on the numbers he's told me this might be thousands of pounds over the years. I view that as\ntheft\n; the money was never hers to keep. Even more galling considering the enormous amount of work and support me and the other housemates offered her when we lived there for which we obviously weren't compensated.\nAm I right to be as outraged as I am about this, and to basically decide to have no contact with this person who I once called a close friend?\nAnd what to do about H, who's still friends with R, and apparently casually discussed the contents of my journal with her a year ago and thought to tell me only now?\nI want to stay friends with H, but I feel blindsided and hurt. I don't know how to broach how upset I am about the whole thing with him or whether I'm being unreasonable.

When I moved out it was sudden and we've barely spoken since. She wants to go on a walk and talk soon; how do I talk to her about this?\nI spent nearly 6 years living in a duplex unit next door to my good friend and her husband, who acted as my landlord, during the pandemic at a time when her cancer came back. Over this time I saw behind the curtains of their relationship and came to resent not only his treatment of her but his poor treatment of me as a tenant.\nAs a landlord he rarely fixed things (this behavior predated the cancer recurrence). It would go on for months with me constantly asking and reminding him to do things such as: pull the noxious weeds in my side yard, repair the doorknobs that had fallen off, plug the fireplace hole that was a giant draft point in the house, repair cracked tiles from the house settling, install the gate he promised to keep my dog in the yard, etc.\nThe more I pushed the more he got an attitude towards me and ignored me. He would argue about the validity of any requests, and even took away storage space I had in the backyard. Yet, without fail, he would email me requesting rent about a week before it was due. I was never late and always paid well before the first, even during the first pandemic year when I was unemployed and burning through my savings.\nOnce while drink he tried to tell me my violent ex was really a \"good guy\" which horrified both me and some of my visiting friends who were within earshot. A couple of times he screamed at me, once because his dog ran into my unit and another was just because I was trying to hold him accountable as a landlord. I tried to just deal with it so there wasn't blowback on my friend but this was increasingly difficult as his drinking spiraled. I also discovered he had raised the rent on me when I was fleeing my violent marriage, 20% higher than what they offered another friend a month prior. I also suspect he was having me split the water bill two ways despite three people using this utility. (Requests for the bills were ignored.)\nIn parallel, I would witness him say disrespectful things to her and just be a general asshole. Partway through my tenancy she told me how he had hit her in the face (the cancer side!) before I'd moved in because she told him to get a job during a fight.\nShe has been the breadwinner for the entirety of their relationship and has also cooked all of the meals, even when she could no longer eat food orally and had to have a g-tube installed. Once I came over to have one of her childhood specialty dishes and he was so drunk he was facedown, ass up on the couch the entire time. This was a common occurrence. Other times he was so drunk that he knocked her down, which could kill her (a fall once sent her to the ICU!) At one point she posted in the support group asking for help with his drinking and he made her remove the post. Sometimes I would read between the lines and realize he was pressuring her for sex.\nShe makes \u201cjokes\u201d about him drinking himself to death and he refuses to get help. No grief counseling, no therapy, just drink more. The amount of caretaking she took on for herself was greater than any of the happy social media posts would suggest.\nTo be fair: as a DV survivor I am extremely sensitive to this situation and his actions kept triggering me. I am also projecting my own feelings about my ex onto him.\nShe loves him, has told me so and I know she will not leave him. I feel very angry at not only him but our mutual friends who, for some reason, side with him. They said she was \u201ccausing drama\u201d by asking for help.\nAlso to be fair: they have been together for so long and he stayed with her through five recurrences and we\u2019re now in the palliative care phase. He is (dysfunctionally) dealing with a major life tragedy.\nHe also has a bad habit of saying nasty mean things about people and I can make some guesses based on looks from other people how he is spinning my departure.\nSo she and I have not spoken much since I left. They both operate on keeping up appearances so it feels nearly impossible to even have this conversation.\nNow she wants to go on a walk with me and I don't know if I should say anything or if I should just avoid the topic. And what if she brings it up?\nI love my friend, hate her partner and have dealt with it by avoiding the topic.\nWhat do?\nposted by\nJaneTheGood\nto\nHuman Relations\n(19 answers total)\n2 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questio", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"friendship\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman is struggling with how to maintain her friendship with a terminally ill friend while harboring resentment toward the friend's abusive partner, whom she lived next door to as a tenant for six years.\",\n  \"poster_gender_reasoning\": \"Strong contextual clues including references to fleeing a violent marriage, being a DV survivor, and gendered language patterns suggest female poster\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_380728", "classification_type": "post"}}

Recently, we had a small argument * over text, not in person * - we live in different cities - where he tried to get me to do something I wasn't that comfortable with (though not that big a deal), and I stood up for myself, and he got angrier and angrier and said if I were there he would shoot me/use his weapons on me, and made it clear he was not joking.

He started saying I was making him angry, and when I tried to stand up for myself in a civil but assertive way, he got even more angry and said that if I were there he would shoot me, plus other things about using his weapons. I tried to clarify that this wasn\u2019t a funny thing to say if he were joking, and he made it clear that he was dead serious.\nI feel very conflicted about this. We haven\u2019t really talked since and I\u2019m not sure if this is like a \u201csometimes in the heat of the moment people say these things but you can still have a relationship with them\u201d or a \u201cthis isn\u2019t salvageable\u201d situation. Can\u2019t really get over the feeling of not feeling safe being around him or feeling like I\u2019ll set him off. He was nice growing up, but started changing as we got older. Was hoping to get some objective outside views on this, and any suggestions for what to do about it and the relationship.\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(41 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"family\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A person's 42-year-old brother threatened to shoot them during a text argument and they are unsure whether the relationship can be salvaged or if they should maintain distance for safety.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_380526", "classification_type": "post"}}

Details below.\nSomeone close to me lied to me in a pretty major way. The fact of the lie itself is pretty quotidian -- it is what it is -- things like that happen, people lie, and under the circumstances, the basic premise of the lie had a practical benefit to it for the lie-teller.\nBut I can't quite wrap my head around the content and delivery of the lie. They had a desire and fantasy for a specific thing happening, and then they told me about it\nas if that specific thing had happened in reality\n. I want to keep things gender-neutral, so for the purposes of my Ask the person who lied to me will be \"Blue\", and all the pronouns will be they/them. I am especially interested in the perspective of people who habitually lie or who used to lie (if you don't feel comfortable posting replies publicly I would also welcome replies via me-mail), or who are professionally familiar with this kind of behavior, i.e. a therapist, psychologist, etc.\nBlue told me that they and their ex-spouse (let's call the ex-spouse Yellow) were reuniting and giving their marriage another chance (they had been married for a long time and had children together, but have been divorced for several years; Yellow had left Blue for another partner, and was living with that new partner). Blue told me in great detail how this reunion came about, how Blue had a family crisis they needed Yellow's help with, how Blue went to Yellow's house and had an emotional breakdown because they were so stressed out, how that led to a conversation about their marriage and what had gone wrong between them. Blue then found out, in the course of this conversation, that Yellow was no longer with the new partner they had left the marriage for, but had been too proud to tell Blue that it didn't work out.  Yellow eventually asked Blue if they could try again, Blue acquiesced, and they agreed that Yellow would move back into Blue's house (which was their marital home before the split), and they would go to couples therapy. Blue reproduced for me the conversation they had, doing direct quotes in both voices even, and tracing for me how this conversation eventually arrived at a joint decision to reconcile. We talked about this for a while, I treated the story as real (because I thought it was), asked follow-up questions, etc. that Blue had thoughtful answers for.\nAll of it, aside from the fact that Blue really was married to and then divorced from Yellow, and the fact that Blue had stressful family stuff going on, turned out to be a complete fabrication. When we discussed it later, Blue told me that they had wanted to get back together with Yellow very badly, saw some problems in Yellow's current relationship, and hoped that these problems would create an opening for Yellow to miss them and come back to them. Blue said that they told me what they deeply hoped for / fantasized about\nas if it had really happened\n.\nPutting aside the explanation that Blue was having a break with reality and was genuinely unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy (for various reasons, I am sure that is not what was going on), can someone help me understand what is either the motivation or the emotional reward for this kind of lying? Is it pleasurable to voice a fantasy to someone and have them treat it as reality? Does having someone else treat a fantasy as if it were true make it feel somehow more real to the speaker? Is that an exciting or comforting feeling? Is it some form of magical thinking / manifesting, i.e. \"if I tell a story about how I want this thing to happen, it's putting it out there into the universe, and it may come true\"? Is it a fear that unless one provides lots and lots of details for verisimilitude, their lie will be recognized as such?\nI would appreciate responses that engage with this specific question. Please refrain from speculating on details I didn't provide, or the broader context. What I want from this Ask is to hopefully gain insight into  an emotional state and behavior (narrating a fantasy in great detail as if it were real) that is so alien to me that I don't have a theory of mind for it.\nposted by\nvirve\nto\nHuman Relations\n(28 answers total)\n7 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"other\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"Someone close to the poster told them an elaborate lie, presenting a detailed fantasy about reuniting with their ex-spouse as if it were reality, and the poster wants to understand the psychological motivation behind this type of deceptive behavior.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_380407", "classification_type": "post"}}

However, they're\nextremely\nignorant of any of it, and I'm looking for specific kinds of materials to help 'get them up to speed' so we can have healthier conversations.\nWhat I'm looking for: Introductory materials about kink that focus on the\npsychology\nof it, and especially breaking down the different approaches within the kink spectrum. For example, introducing concepts\nsuch as\n* Styles of dom/sub play\n* Humiliation play vs praise vs combining the two\n* Funishment vs \"real\" punishment\n* Being a brat vs a 'willing\" or \"eager\" submissive\n* Generally\nwhy\nsomebody might enjoy activity X or Y or who might like it, not just\nhow to do it\nA book would actually be ideal; websites are fine too. Instagram or other social follows are\nnot\nhelpful, my partner isn't active on social and that won't provide the 'research' we're looking for.\nIf this includes some \"how to\" that's fine too, but the materials we've found so far focus heavily on the physical or mechanical side of things - \"here's how to safely spank somebody\" - without really digging into any of the \"who would even like to be spanked, and why.\" I literally just want her to know\nwhat the universe looks like\nso I can point to something and say \"I'm into that\" and not then have to explain every single part of what that means.\nSome context: We're a cishet couple in our mid-30s, I'm M she's F, together for a few months. I would badly like to introduce kink to our sexual play (in the past I've been in multiple kinky relationships, both as a dom and sub). In\nprincipal\nmy partner is extremely willing to try things out. In\npractice\nwe have a big barrier: Language and knowledge. Her main prior sexual relationship was extremely vanilla, and her cultural background was sex neutral-to-negative. She has minimal knowledge of kink, and what she does know is often limited or incomplete - for example when hearing that I like to submit sometimes, she assumed this meant I wanted to be aggressively physically hurt and insulted in specific ways, because that's the only context she had.\nClearing this up has been especially challenging because both my last (abusive) relationship involved a lot of \"weaponized ignorance,\" and explaining things in deep detail like this can often feel very triggering and anxiety-inducing for me (Yes, I'm in therapy). \"If you don't explain in incredibly exhausting detail every part of what you want, you won't get anything because I'll pretend I don't know about it, and if you leave even a single thing out, you'll never get it\" was a big part of their abusive behavior. It's a huge step for me to just have the confidence to ask \"I want to do this kink thing\" - it's a step too far to then have to explain what that means in every respect.\nHer own analogy as a big hobby chef was \"you want to be able to ask me to sometimes make you sweet desserts without having to explain what sweet vs savory means, and then I'd know enough. to just ask how you feel about apple pie and you don't have introduce the concept of fruit along the way.\"\nSo, I'm hoping you all have some websites or books to recommend. I certainly wouldn't mind if there was some 'how to,' but my interests are much more about the psychological side of d/s than the mechanical.

On paper, we were perfect together. He had all of the qualities I could ask for in a partner (kind, generous, motivated, intelligent, handsome, empathetic).\nHowever, we had little to no sexual chemistry. I struggle to explain why this was; all I know is that once the NRE had worn off about a year in, I lost almost all desire to have sex with him. There was no obvious hormonal or medical reason for this, and nothing dramatic had changed about his actions or appearance. Part of it may have stemmed from the fact that he was incredibly reluctant to try anything new sexually (I was always the one to suggest trying anything remotely new or out of the norm and often felt rebuffed or like he was uncomfortable with what I was proposing), and rarely initiated. We also never flirted with each other. While he did give me compliments generally, I never felt sexually desired. In short, the dynamic between us felt increasingly platonic, to the point that I cared about him deeply and respected him as a person but felt very little in the way of romantic love. If I am completely honest, I don\u2019t think I would have been particularly perturbed if he had told me he had cheated on me (if anything, I think it would have helped me to see him as more of a sexual being). I became increasingly stressed and anxious as the relationship progressed, particularly as we began discussing moving in together. Ultimately, I ended the relationship because of this. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m now back in the dwindling dating pool and finding it a struggle.

It seems reasonable, but it's a big shift in our friendship and emotional connection, and I am having some feelings about it all and trying to figure out if it's worth a conversation or something I need to instead process on my own and with my therapist.\nMy friend Laura and I both, both 40-something-is cis women, have grown from acquaintances to friends over the past three years. We met through a shared activity and then bonded further in conversations about dating and relationships. She is smart and funny, a true delight. We interact via text, social media, and sometimes phone calls multiple times a week and usually see each other at least once a week, sometimes more, depending on our shared activity.\nOver the past few years, I supported her through a few break ups, and she did the same for me. I had a pretty emotionally wrenching break up a few months ago, and I leaned on her heavily. She listened to my tales of woe and said to call her or text her instead of my ex, that kind of thing. I briefly dated someone last month, and talked to her about that as well. I am in therapy, and have other folks to talk to, but she was probably my primary listening and supporting friend.\nShe's been dealing with some depression this past winter and spring (she's in therapy and doing all the things). Her break up last year hit her really hard, and she's gotten pretty negative about men and dating generally. She said she was feeling a bit overwhelmed with relationship talk in a few different contexts, among another group of women friends she spends time with, and then with some individual friends. A month or so ago, she said she didn't want to talk about relationships any more. My understanding is that she was asking for this to some extent in other friendships too.\nLaura has people pleasing tendencies, and we have talked about practicing secure attachment behaviors in our friendship and also about setting good boundaries, but I think all my relationship processing with her might have been overwhelming her for a while before she set this boundary. She asked to take breaks from these topics a few times. In retrospect, I wish I had been a bit more aware and understanding of what she was communicating more subtly.\nI respect her request and the boundary, but it's also a really big change in our dynamic. I am a verbal processor and extroverted and have ADHD, and I can really meander in conversation, so it's taken some real effort on my part not to bring up this kind of stuff when we chat, and it's harder to relax around her (though maybe I was too relaxed before?). She's also sort of half-flinched when I mentioned things that were associated with my ex, even when I didn't mention my ex, so I am trying to be mindful of that as well. If we are discussing our week, I might bring up lots of things but talk around (for example) the text I got from my ex, or a new date I set up.\nA couple of weeks ago, while participating in our shared activity and chatting, she mentioned that another friend of ours, Amanda, had called her and talked about some problems in Amanda's situationship. Laura also told me about a new crush she's developed lately. I engaged actively and happily with her on both topics, but it felt terrible that this was one sided. I felt jealous that Amanda was able (allowed?) to have that conversation with Laura. And I was a bit resentful that Laura talked about her mini crush but I still wasn't allowed to talk about some of my dating stuff.\nI have another friend, Rhonda, who stopped dating a few years ago and also drew the same boundary. She felt like there was too much relationship talk among all her friends, especially because she was actively supporting another friend who was leaving an abusive relationship. In fact, when I became closer with Laura and Amanda, Rhonda commented how happy she was for me to have friends to talk to about dating and such. So now I am trying to figure out if this is me -- am I completely exhausting my friends with too much relationship processing? -- and also how to move forward in my friendship with Laura.\nI haven't told Laura that this boundary, though reasonable, has been a struggle for me. It's also a huge shift in the content of our conversations. She's in a tender place, and I don't want to hurt her feelings or pressure her in any way into uncomfortable conversations. But I feel a lot less authentic with her, I feel judged for my dating and relationship, and I am bit mad that she's not realizing that talking about her crush with me isn't exactly fair given the boundary she established.\nAny tips on moving forward? Should I tell her that I respect this boundary but am also struggling with it? Should I ask her not to discuss her crush with me if I can't tell he", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"friendship\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman is struggling with her friend Laura's new boundary against discussing relationships, feeling the restriction is unfair since Laura still talks about her own dating life and discusses other friends' relationship issues.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_380076", "classification_type": "post"}}

I was also depressed at the time, could not recognize it yet, and further failed to respond to my partner's needs at the time. I feel a constant guilt for my actions. How does anyone cope with being the reason a relationship falls apart and feeling worthy again?\nI intend to remain single for a while because I know I am nowhere near ready to enter another relationship or attempt dating, but I am still fearing I'll repeat my mistakes again when the time comes, and that my actions already make me far too unworthy of being loved any more or better in the future. I've also realized since the break-up I've built a bit of an inferiority complex. She hurt me in some ways, but I hurt her more. Looking back, I still see her so highly, to the point where I find her life more important than mine. I know it's wrong, though. I know she's a person with flaws as well.\nI have tried focusing on myself, giving myself hobbies to do so that I can redirect my thoughts and maybe build my confidence. It has helped to an extent and I know to keep going, but at some points I feel like I don't deserve to feel good again. My train of thought is, \"why should I be trying to uplift myself now when I let someone I loved down\". Am I worthy of compassion from others? Am I worthy of self-compassion? Am I worthy of something better one day, when I was the bad part of a previous relationship? I guess I'd like to hear from anyone who's been in similar situations.

It\u2019s a topic that comes up often, especially given that he comes from an immigrant Israeli family (atheists, critical of Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians).   I am heartbroken and outraged by the Gaza war, he supports it.  I\u2019ve tried to manage this by avoiding the topic with him, but as time grinds on, I feel more and more confused as to who he is.  Contempt and disgust are creeping in, and it is terrifying.  What can I do?\nHe has said and done plenty of things that reinforce the explicit conversations we\u2019ve had - he won\u2019t work for companies that take defense contracts, strongly opposes the selective service system, opposes the death penalty, believes that even serial killers deserve quality of life and the chance to live productive lives in prison, stopped visiting Israel when he was twelve because of his feelings about government treatment of Palestinians, rejects \u00ab\u00a0Jewish\u00a0\u00bb and \u00ab\u00a0Israeli\u00a0\u00bb as identities or labels.  Our wedding lasted about fifteen minutes, and two of those minutes were spent singing Last Night I Had The Strangest Dream with our guests, a song that he taught me from his childhood summers spent at a socialist Jewish summer camp.\nIt makes some sense that this particular conflict is different for him despite all this, but that doesn\u2019t help me navigate the disgust that I\u2019m feeling.  Last week, the first time we talked about this in months, he said that he agreed with me on a number of things, and then proceeded to justify the starvation of civilians because \u00ab\u00a0it is Hamas\u2019 fault\u00a0\u00bb.  We\u2019ve been able to connect since then, but I feel anxious and sick to my stomach a lot of the time.\nI am hoping that other people here have navigated difficult moral questions with their partners and have advice from that experience.  If your advice is DTMFA, it won\u2019t help.

In summary - I've been in a situationship for 6 years now. Meaning sex (though rarely these days due to antidepressants and general lack of attraction on my end), cuddles, picking each other up from the airport, hanging out almost every day, and saying I love you. At times I've deluded myself into thinking this is a partnership despite the lack of labels, but last week I identified myself as his partner when speaking with him and he said \"no, not really\". This is not what I envisioned for my life - it's humiliating to not be chosen as his girlfriend. It\u2019s humiliating to not have met his parents. And I\u2019ve hidden it from my family this entire time - if anything, they think we were good friends that dated briefly. I very much want to get married or at least have a long term committed relationship. I also feel uncomfortable and unhappy around him a lot of the time.\nIn a rare moment of bravery, I tried to break up with him a few months ago. We both cried, and I left feeling absolutely devastated and empty. Worse than I remember feeling in my entire life. Being alone is my worst fear. I texted one of the few friends I have, from work, and didn\u2019t get much support - basically, it was too much to dump on someone that I am only casually friends with. I have one other friend that I hang out with on occasion. Other than that, I am pretty much alone. I do have great coworkers, great people that I volunteer with, a great roommate, and other various great acquaintances, as well as the support of a very kind therapist. She has not given me much advice besides reminding me of the reasons I expressed not being happy with this situation, but I can\u2019t get myself to take the leap again. I got back together with him within 24 hours after crying hysterically at work and feeling deeply suicidal. Basically I have no support network outside of him. Our relationship is a flawed way of getting my needs met. What he is getting out of it I\u2019m not sure of.\nI have very few friends left from high school or after. I tend to burn bridges, sometimes unconsciously. I am very negative, anxious, and avoidant. If someone expresses interest in being friends, I find a way to push them away or convince myself that I\u2019m not deserving of their friendship. I also think very badly of myself. I feel ashamed of who I am. If I think about my life too hard, I feel humiliated about what other people must think of me. I also feel like a bad and selfish person. I dislike the way I interact with people- it is always awkward, and I tend to fawn and play dumb to avoid conflict. I haven\u2019t developed much of an identity because I am always inside staring at my computer or my phone. My relationship with him has also gotten in the way of forming other relationships - both because it takes up a lot of time, and also because it\u2019s an easy way to fulfill my need for socializing without meeting new people or challenging myself.\nAnyway, I\u2019m reaching out in hope that someone has experienced something like this or can give me a starting point. Stories about the ending of bad relationships leading to better ones would be deeply appreciated. So far the best ideas I have are trying to build more hobbies and interests that get me out of the house. I also want to try more low stakes socializing - volunteer work, clubs and classes, and doing pottery at a studio near my house. I am medicated and meeting with a psychiatrist again in a few weeks to reevaluate my meds.\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(21 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nR", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A person has been in an undefined 6-year situationship where their partner refuses to commit or acknowledge them as a girlfriend, causing distress and isolation.

Turns out, what was described as \"some travel to begin with\" has turned into him flying overseas Mon-Fri, every week for an unknown period of time. It could be two months or it could be a year. I feel a bit blindsided by this, please help me figure out how to cope.\nWe're a cis-het couple, late 30s, together for four years happily childfree. Two of those years were long-distance: shortly after we started dating he took a job overseas during the pandemic. He convinced me he would move back to my country after a fixed period of time so we should try and make it work, and I'm really glad we did, even though it was really tough. For the past two years, we have been living together and it has been wonderful. It's a very emotionally healthy relationship that is worth holding onto.\nWhen he moved back to my country, he took a WFH job that turned out to be a really bad fit. He realised he had burnout, didn't really know what he wanted next, took some time off work. This was great, he saw a career coach, did some volunteering, his mental health really improved. When this new job came up it sounded perfect and I was so happy for him.\nThe job is based at a site that has not yet been built, in our area. In the meantime, he is travelling to other sites to train up. I knew this before he accepted the role. What I didn't realise is that the other sites are mostly overseas, and the new site won't open until this time next year (assuming all goes to plan). Somehow I had in mind that he would need to travel for a couple of months at most. In the first week he asked how long he would be expected to travel for, and his new manager told him he had no idea, saying: \"as soon as I know when my own travel stops, I'll let you know too\".\nI wish I had understood this before he accepted, so I could have discussed my reservations in advance. I know he didn't do it intentionally, but he wasn't super clear about the specifics, and we didn't have a proper conversation about how it would affect our relationship, how to cope with it. Otherwise, I might have asked him to insist on at least a ballpark timeframe for the travel before accepting the role.\nNot knowing how long he will be travelling for is really hard for me. If it was a month or two, it would suck but I would handle it. Even if I knew for sure it would be a year, that would help me to evaluate and plan. Right now I feel stuck and very sad. He is super apologetic about not explaining everything clearly. I know he values the relationship more than the job and would quit if I asked him to, but I really don't want to do that. He is thriving in this role. I worry he'd never find an opportunity like this again, eat through his savings and become embittered. And why would I ask him to quit if it's only going to be two or three months?\nDoes anyone have any advice on coming to terms with a big life change of unknown duration? Any tips on coping with the distance would also be great. I figured out how to handle it when I didn't see him for weeks or months at a time--it was a bit like being single, still. But this constant coming and going is a lot more angsty and I'm hating the continual Sunday blues.\nposted by\nguessthis\nto\nHuman Relations\n(16 answers total)\n1 user marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman is struggling to cope with her boyfriend's new job requiring extensive overseas travel for an unknown duration, feeling blindsided by the arrangement and seeking advice on managing the uncertainty and distance.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_379317", "classification_type": "post"}}

I barely remember most of it!

It's not that she has ever explained *different* understandings of these concepts, theorists she prefers, critiques or so on. Just acts like I'm speaking an arcane, different language, when all she wants to talk about how unfair it is that plumbers can get tax write-offs on their vehicles and it's sad how the housing market isn't good for young people.\nShe's the one with the degree in economics, I'm a dabbling amateur.

Also; people who are snobby/juvenile? I suppose under that question is - how do you figure out when to stick it out with a connection and see if the person grows and changes?\nI've [27f] been seeing this guy [25m], let's call him M, for almost two months now. I was in a total infatuation haze for month one but then slowly started to notice that M had what I would describe as cooked ideas. In one conversation he said something along the lines of \"anyone who listens to Taylor Swift isn't a real man, that music is only for teenage girls and it's garbage\". In another about how long was a reasonable amount of time to stay upset over something, he said to me \"you should try to control your emotions, don't you want to show that women aren't over-emotional\".\nThat conversation revolved around me having residual feelings of distance/upset following a discussion about an issue (in this case, his harsh language in the first scenario and how it makes me feel as someone who likes Taylor Swift's music while also admittedly enjoying ripping into her place in the culture industry) threatens his sense of self and that he can't be around me if I feel upset about his actions even after he's apologised. To be clear, me being upset in that situation looked like me calmly telling him I didn't appreciate him being so harsh, and then me being a bit more distant during our conversation for about half an hour afterwards because I was taken aback by the incident, but still maintaining physical closeness and being present.\nAll of this has been enough for me to be pretty sure I don't want to date him anymore because I can't be attracted to someone who has such a juvenile outlook on things and expresses himself with all the grace of a 14 year old.\nHowever, I always want to approach connections from a place of believing that people can grow and I actually think M has a lot of capacity to do so. I think part of why his outlook is so under-developed is because he lost about 6 years of his life to a health condition that basically hormonally changed his personality and made it impossible for him to live a normal life. Only over the last year or so is he emerging from this and I can see in him the seeds of someone who is self-aware and emotionally sensitive. He has been able to listen to me and change his behaviour when I have asked him to do so, e.g. about the harsh language - but his ideas on gender and emotions are more deeply rooted and he has said he feels entitled to hold those opionions. So - he has potential, but is also someone who has developed a protective (but clearly very fragile) ego complex that gives him a sense of power through certain ideas of masculinity and 'good' culture.\nUnfortunately for me, there are parts of our connection that I really enjoy and we connect over many shared activities and intellectual/art-related pursuits that I don\u2019t share in the same way with other people. When we first met, it felt like I was meeting someone with whom I really shared a way of looking at the world and could explore ideas and film and music and books with in fulfilling ways. Now that this person has turned out to be emotionally immature and incapable of the kind of intimacy that I wanted to share, I'm torn about whether to cut him off completely or try stay friends.\nI value and cherish the things we've shared and want to continue sharing them, but I really don't respect certain parts of his worldview and think they are actively harmful. I believe in people's capacity to change and think that we change in relationship with others so if we cut ties with everyone we disagreed with, people's toxic ideas would only ossify and become more entrenched. I know that part of the answer is that I should sense out my own red line boundary and stick to it, and I don't expect folks to be able to find that for me - what I'd really appreciate hearing is if anyone has navigated any similar situations and/or what your philosophy is when it comes to giving people space to change.\nThank you for bearing with me!\nposted by\nfantasticbotanical\nto\nHuman Relations\n(25 answers total)\n2 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for conte", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A 27-year-old woman is questioning whether to continue dating a 25-year-old man who holds sexist views and is emotionally immature, despite their intellectual compatibility and his potential for growth.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_378895", "classification_type": "post"}}

And I mean, I\u2019m cool and all, but so are you. Quite frankly, I struggle to even see the envy, but multiple trusted friends have assured me that this is happening which means it\u2019s likely a pretty big blind spot for me.\nThese trusted people say I have a chill, open vibe and tend to not be overly affected by things. I\u2019m authentic, smart, I work on myself and I have my shit (mostly) together. One friend said I\u2019m shiny and some folks in my life are jealous of that shine.\nOne friend said she\u2019s seen people be jealous of how warmly I\u2019m received. Another friend said my ex was envious when he basically refused to connect with others at my birthday party and he sat by himself despite me inviting him into the group. Another friend talked about a different ex who cut me down in conversation. I don\u2019t remember it as well as she did, but she was very clear that he was jealous of my intelligence and my friendships.\nFolks who are jealous will sometimes lash out at me, or give me micro aggressions. When I recently told a family member about something I\u2019m hoping for, she said something like \u201cOh that seems like a tall order\u201d. Basically cutting me down and expressing that I shouldn\u2019t get too big for my britches. This has happened in work situations too, when I offered up suggestions that solved problems for one colleague in particular, she\u2019d make negative comments or scoff (and then go do what I suggested).\nI feel genuinely mystified when people do all these things, and I don\u2019t usually assume it\u2019s about them - I\u2019ll often investigate if it\u2019s something I\u2019ve said or is something I need to work on. Again my close friends are like \u201cOh honey, it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them.\u201d\nAnyone have thoughts, resources, suggestions or ideas for how to handle this? I suppose it could help to learn where it comes from, but honestly it's mostly that I want to respond to people with compassion and care - but that does not seem to be easy when there's this kind of response. I am a woman, I get that some of this can be gendered. Resources on that are welcome too. Mostly I\u2019d like to find ways to identify and respond to jealousy that feels authentic and doesn\u2019t involve me going in a tailspin about what I did to provoke this reaction.\nBecause honestly I kinda like being shiny. :)\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(20 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"other\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A person is seeking advice on how to handle jealousy and envy from various people in their life (exes, family, coworkers) who respond negatively to their positive traits and success.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_378608", "classification_type": "post"}}

Help me find perspective and patience!\nSo, yes, this is the partner from\nthis Ask\n. We did formalize our relationship shortly after that, and began officially dating; we live together about half the year. For those who brought it up previously; yes, he does tend to fit the anxious-avoidant attachment style and has a lot of fear that I will leave him; he tends to react to that fear, when it flares up, by distancing himself or by pretending that it would be fine and he would handle it fine.\nThat knowledge doesn't, however, make it easier to deal with the skittishness around marriage, specifically. When it seemed like it was less *actually* possible/realistic, he initiated and talked about it more: now it *is* possible/realistic, and he is avoiding the idea like the plague. When we explicitly talked about this, there was a lot of \"why bring the government into a relationship\" and \"People should never be forced to be together longer than they want to be\". However, when talking about us, I believe that he is very sincere that he wants to be together for the rest of our lives. He's open and interested in us setting up legal trusts to handle our money and inheritances for children together - it's just the idea of marriage specifically that he's balking at.\nHe does have some trauma around the issue, having had a difficult marriage/divorce previously, and having been cheated on in the past, and I understand that he has a lot of fear of embracing hope. But the sudden rejection of the idea, especially after the previous embrace of it, is leaving *me* feeling rejected, and especially since he's previously been married, making me feel like somehow I'm not measuring up to his ex-wife, or that he doesn't trust *me*, and all sorts of ridiculous other things. I very much want to be married to him; the formalization of marriage as a moral/legal/social bond is more important to me than the financial entanglements that can be handled by contract. I do understand that not everyone gets married these days, but I'm somewhat old fashioned on this issue; it means a lot to me and would mean a lot to me coming from him specifically. I know that I need to have patience on this issue, but I'm finding it difficult.

She lives at home with her parents and two younger siblings. For about a year, she's been wanting to move out. Her parents were against that all along - they think she should stay at home while she's in school, and ideally even for the first couple years of college. I believe this is partly a financial decision: While college itself is free here, they'd have to pay for lodging. However, the situation at home is not ideal. I want to help this young adult get herself into a safe place.\nThe problem: At home, my niece is very often (daily?) in conflict with other family members. Most notably, this is her dad, who has outbursts of anger that include awful insults and even displays of violence against objects. This scares Amy, who gets the brunt of it at the moment (the younger siblings are fine so far).\nNow, through a friend, I found a cheap housesharing option. The area is safe, close to school\nand\ncollege, she can take her cat...when Amy heard about it, she was delighted. She hopes that moving out will improve the relationship to her parents.\nBut we didn't anticipate the amount of pushback she'd get from them. They are now saying they'd cut her off (not sure if that's legal around here). Even if they did, Amy has a weekend job and would almost certainly receive what amounts to 500$ of student housing assistance (twice the rent). So she could actually make this work somehow.\nMy main question is: If I want to keep helping her with this (which I do), how do I talk to her mother? Mom is texting me saying I should prevent this from happening. I can't really, but also - I don't want to. I hear her parents' concerns about finishing school first (they say she's too anxious to do it on her own), but I hear Amy's concerns about the conflict, too. Amy's a very responsible kid and I'm almost certain she will finish school no matter what. Plus, it's important to be said that she'd most likely still see her parents regularly - this is all happening in the same town. She's not moving across the country by herself.\nIn a nutshell: if I don't want crazy drama, I will have to help Amy, but lie or at least evade with her parents. My moral compass is conflicted. I\nthink\nit's more important to help the kid.

I've asked for advice about it on MeFi some time ago and I've now reached the point where I recognise that I need to ask for a divorce for my own sanity and health. All my instincts are telling me not to do it even though rationally I'm pretty certain it's a good idea. I'm struggling most with the feeling that I don't have a right to ask and a fear that my partner will spiral into a depression and some harm will come to him.\nI keep thinking of that statistic that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship and I'm kind of horrified because I can tell some of the things that go on in your brain that keep you trapped are happening to me but I also feel powerless to stop them.\nOne thing I notice I'm doing is obsessing over the perfect way to ask as if there's a way I can make it not hurt and get him to agree with me that it's a good idea. But I can see that that might cause me to put it off indefinitely. I keep thinking I can't say it now because it's christmas, or if he has a thing at work and he's stressed, or if I'm feeling angry because then I won't be perfectly rational about it. That if I wait to talk to our relationship therapist I might change my mind about leaving.\nI've heard the advice that you should go about this in a way that's kind, and I really want to if only for the selfish reason that seeing him hurting is really distressing to me. But that's freezing me up as well because I can't see a way to do this that won't hurt him and I don't understand what kind means otherwise. Usually kind to me means helping other people feel less stressed and overwhelmed by taking things on myself. I've never broken up with anyone in my life and I get anxious just thinking about disappointing or inconveniencing people.\nI've seen enough of how he acted at the end of previous relationships to know that this isn't the kind of situation where I'm imagining that he cares and that he'll be fine and moved on to someone else immediately. He is really serious about the relationship, wants to find a way to make it work, and will be really hurt and probably struggling for a long while. The fact that his behaviour has been genuinely better in the past year and that he's obviously putting effort in, and we've had a lot of good happy times recently, is making me feel more awful. It just doesn't feel like the good times are enough to outweigh the bad and it doesn't feel like things will get enough better for me to stop feeling stressed, but it feels weird and unfair to him that I've reached some sort of limit now when things are in many ways better.\nI keep hearing the advice that the only thing you need to to do to have a right to leave a relationship is want to leave, and that makes sense on some cognitive level, but how do I get myself to believe it? I both don't believe I have the right to do something that helps me if it hurts someone else, and I don't believe I'll be safe if I do that even if I wanted to because growing up that kind of behaviour had negative repercussions.\nHelp, MeFi. Please help me puts my needs first here while navigating just how distressing and overwhelming this all feels.\nOh, and I should say I have support in the form of therapy and financial independence, which I think has gotten me to this point, but the closer I get the more resistance I also feel, so I feel like I need some final push.\nposted by\nanonymous\nto\nHuman Relations\n(21 answers total)\n4 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_ad", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"Person is seeking advice on how to leave a difficult marriage with red flags for abuse, struggling with feelings of guilt and fear about hurting their partner despite recognizing the need to divorce for their own wellbeing.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_377394", "classification_type": "post"}}

They are feeling well enough to want to spend one-on-one quality time with me now, though, and we've been having good conversations when I come by. We are \"taking things slow,\" and it's been really nice so far.\nI'm looking for advice on low-pressure activities we can do together that also work with Alex's current limitations. Mentally, Alex is doing pretty well, but physically, everything is still a challenge. They spend most of the day in bed, and even things that don't look strenuous can be really tiring for them. For example, they enjoy knitting but can only do it for very short periods. Movies and TV are too much visually. Listening to music and podcasts are fine though.\nI like doing things like planning and cooking a special meal for a date, but given Alex's inability to reciprocate in the same ways, I'm conscious of not wanting to fall into doing all the work and creating too much of a caregiver dynamic. So ideas on how to make things a team effort would be great.

They role play the counsellor/client relationship in front of others, but the issues they bring to the table tend to be real.\nMy cousin has just telephoned in tears because today at one session a man, in his 20s, remarked that he finds it hard to listen to my cousin as counsellor and his mind drifts and he doesn't get on with her 'heady' style. I think it's all in the intonation as 'heady' was delivered as a negative not in the positive sense of the word.\nThis prompted a faint echo from another woman, who my cousin had already noticed is reluctant to meet her eye/work with her.\nApart from these two, my cousin is thriving on the course both socially and academically. She has previously looked forward to residentials but I fear will now be very anxious before the next round.\nI've prompted her to report this to the course tutor, but she's minded to take the problem on as a 'her problem' and try to correct whatever behaviour in her is prompting this response in them.\nAbout my cousin: she has lots of friends, is generally very well liked and is seen as a genuine and loving person.

We'd known each other for a few years and I had been a little attracted to them for a while, but had never given it much thought. They are a very caring and intelligent person with a similar sense of humor to mine and we really enjoy spending time together.\nWell, it didn't take long before I developed a huge crush on them (with all the excitement and anxiety that entails). I was/am almost certain they were into me too, but also could tell their feelings were not in a \"thinking about you all the time\" place like mine are. That said, there was a definite vibe when we hung out, and their roommate/oldest friend (also my friend) told me that when they got home from watching a movie with me, they were acting \"giddy\" and \"smiley\" in a way they don't act after getting together with friends, and she thinks we would be a great couple.\u00a0I do think this is someone I would be very compatible with long term.\nI'm not shy about asking people out. And when I've had unrequited crushes on friends before, as long as the person rejected me in a normal, non-shitty way, I was able to get over it and go back to being friends easily. I trust this friend would be normal and non-shitty about it, so nothing to lose, right? However, I know my crush is someone who is overwhelmed by sudden big life changes, and they were\u00a0also very preoccupied with and anxious about their ongoing health issues. I decided to do nothing and try to chill for a month or so, to let things settle and manage my intense feelings better, before sharing my feelings in a low-pressure way.\nWell, soon after I made this decision, they were hit with a really bad, scary flare up of their chronic illness, which is significantly worse than any that has happened before and left them unable to take care of their basic needs independently. Most likely, this is temporary and they are already feeling a bit better, but I think it will take a while to get back to where they were before this happened.\nThey also don't have much of a support system. Roommate and I have been doing 100% of the caretaking, which isn't specialized medical assistance, but stuff like making sure they have food and their medication and that chores are done. We don't feel comfortable leaving them alone, so anytime the roommate has to be out of the apartment I am there. Thankfully I work from home so I can do this. We know we're going to have to figure out\u00a0how to get more support because this wouldn't be sustainable indefinitely.\nI know my crush-friend just needs a friend and practical assistance right now and this would be the worst possible time to spring my feelings on them. They are vulnerable and depending on me, and I would hate having them feel like I'm expecting something in return, or be afraid of losing my support if they didn't want to date me (they would not lose my support), or think I am only helping because I think I'm going to get something out of it (which I'm not! I would do this for any good friend and am also there to help the roommate/mutual friend).\nI'm having a really hard time dealing with the situation emotionally, though. I think I'm doing a good job of \"comfort in, dump out,\" but I'm really worried about them and it is scary and sad to see them like this. It's also really hard to set my romantic feelings aside when I just want to crawl into bed with them and hold them. I also don't want to let myself get stuck in what would be a really unhealthy situation for me emotionally, that is, long-term caregiving for someone I have unspoken feelings for that I feel like I have to keep to myself. Like I know not to say anything when they wouldn't be able to get a glass of water without me, but when things improve they are still going to need help, so when does it end? I'm also worried that I'll get an answer that is that not that they aren't into me like that (easy to move on from) but that they can't start a relationship because of everything going on with them (which would not be easy to move on from because, in these circumstances, it would probably not just be a \"nice\" way to say they are not into me like that kind of comment usually is, and I would hold out hope).\nAnyway...help? How would you want me to handle this if you were my sick friend? If you have had similar health problems, do you think I'm right to \"protect\" someone from having to deal with my feelings, when in normal circumstances the existence of these feelings is something they would probably be happy to learn about,\u00a0and if not would be understanding and kind about?

I've had multiple relationships since without any fears related to infidelity, but for some reason, my latest relationship has been seriously triggering anxiety around being cheated on, and I'm trying to understand why that is and what I can do to prevent it from making me unhappy or screwing up the relationship.\nA bit of background: I (26M) was cheated on in my first 'serious' relationship. I spent months unable to shake the feeling that something was off and my partner wasn't being honest with me; she responded by telling me it was 'killing' her that I couldn't trust her. I ended up hating myself for most of that relationship, wracked with guilt for being unable to trust this wonderful, loving person, and for a long time I felt like I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't. Very soon after we split up, I found out that-- wait for it-- she'd been cheating on me throughout the relationship with a bunch of different people. That was fun. Fast forward a few years and a handful of relationships, throughout which I don't think I experienced any irrational fears of infidelity or anything like that as a result of my first relationship. I have some minor unrelated anxieties, but I like to think I came by those all by myself.\nA few months ago I began a relationship with someone (27F) I've been good friends with since high school. It has been long-distance for much of it (shortly after it began, I had to temporarily relocate for work, but will be returning around the start of next year) but it's been wonderful so far; we've talked a lot about how right it feels to be together, about how we've both thought about this for a long time, and about how much we'd like this to be a lifelong thing. Having known each other and been friends so long, it doesn't feel 'new', per se.\nHere's where fear comes in. She and a close-knit group of female friends have been planning a trip to New Orleans for a while; they flew out over the weekend, along with her mother, who will be staying there as well but in separate accommodations. The night she was packing to fly out, I started feeling a little weird, and I had no idea why. That feeling persisted, slightly aggravated by a completely understandable decrease in rate of communication while she's exploring a new city with friends (we still text throughout the day, albeit less than usual, and we even still FaceTime each day just to check in-- when I let her know she didn't need to feel obligated to take time out of her trip, she told me very clearly that she liked calling). Then, yesterday, she mentioned that she and her friends were planning to check out a former-sex-club-turned-nightclub a waiter had told them about, in what I guess is a \"seems interesting, let's check it out\" way. And it's been on my mind all morning.\nThat was pretty much when it finally clicked why I was feeling so weird: my first partner, as I found out after the fact, would sometimes cheat on me at nightclubs. And I guess that's what's had me cooking, particularly since my partner told me their plans but in some sense even since she flew out for the trip-- I'm afraid of getting cheated on. I even had this passing thought-- very, very passing, I immediately discarded it, but it bugs me that it even came up-- of her FaceTiming me from the club in the middle of cheating on me. Like, just ludicrous. But it's usually not specific thoughts so much as a general sense of foreboding that I just can't seem to shake.\nI'm really confused as to why this fear of infidelity is coming up now. This is a woman who has had exactly two sexual partners (myself included) and has never slept with anyone because she wants to wait until marriage. For religious reasons, she doesn't drink, except the rare sip if a friend has an interesting drink, and she's never been drunk. She's said in her last relationship, if she ever began to find herself attracted to someone else, she actively took steps to mitigate it (texting with them less frequently, not spending time one-on-one, etc). She enjoys going out and socializing, but is generally on the shyer side and has never been one for wild parties. All of her friends have long-time partners, and at her suggestion I met two of them for the first time over FaceTime the night she mentioned the nightclub. Her\nmother\nis on the trip (albeit not going to the club or staying with them). Most importantly, I know her. I trust her. None of this is to put her on a pedestal or create some kind of Madonna complex, absolutely not, but rather to express how baffled I am that this fear of being cheated on is cropping up in\nthis\nsituation and never in any past relationships. This is the absolute last person who is going to go to a party city, get drunk at a club, and cheat.\nAnd yet, there's a part of me that remembers rati", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"male\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A 26-year-old man is experiencing irrational fears of being cheated on by his current girlfriend while she's on a trip to New Orleans, despite trusting her and having no logical reason for concern, which he traces back to being cheated on in his first serious relationship.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_376317", "classification_type": "post"}}

This is entirely outside of my habits, and I\u2019m deciding whether to mention it. Is this a common thing for other people? I have questions for poppers-by.\nI\u2019d guess popping-by attitudes are context-dependent, so here\u2019s our context\u2026\n- We live in a privately-sited house. We can just make out one other house through a lot of trees, and the street is a long driveway away. The friend\u2019s own house is similar.\n- He\u2019s a young 70 and we\u2019re in our 50s.

My partner recently made a joke that implied I was incompetent and don't know what I'm doing, and I don't know if this is a red/yellow flag.\nI've been dealing with a toxic work environment lately, where some management level people have been bullying everyone else (lying, sabotaging, talking down, verbal abuse, gaslighting, stealing credit, etc.). I am figuring out my next steps, but for now I am still need to show up for work every day. It got to a point recently where multiple people on the team (all of whom were great, hard working, smart coworkers who actually did the work) quit or left recently, and they have reported it to HR and been vocal about the toxic management/culture being the reason they're leaving.\nI was saying goodbyes to one of them, and they told me as a way of being supportive that I shouldn't doubt myself because all the toxic people are incompetent and don't know what they're doing, and they hide it by putting other people down/making other people feel bad about themselves. That kind of culture really impacts and damages your confidence if you've been in that for too long, and a lot of us were being affected in this way.\nSo later that day, I was recapping the day to my partner, and I only just started saying \"I had a goodbye meetup with my coworker who's leaving, and they said all those people there are incompetent and don't know what they're doing\". And my partner said in a joking manner \"Oh, were they talking about you? haha.\"\nI actually felt really hurt by this, my partner knows about everything that's been going on and how I already am mentally drained by having to take the hits to confidence at work and dealing with the toxic environment. And I just felt it was really inappropriate and insulting for him to joke that I'm incompetent and don't know what I'm doing. Like I already have to deal with it all day at work, and then have him pile on me even more at home.\nI know sometimes people have \"foot in their mouth\" syndrome, but I think this cut a little deeper because in the past, every once in awhile he's made jokes that make me feel stupid like sarcastically saying \"well DUH it's so and so\" or \"yeah OF COURSE this would be etc etc.\".\nHe also has made comments that imply the company he works for is superior and that people who work there are smarter than everyone else. It's not super frequent though, only like a few times a year. When I tell him it bothers me, he seems genuinely sorry and definitely stops saying that particular thing (like he stopped saying \"DUH\"), but then after awhile he'll make a joke that still makes me feel that way. I've mostly gotten over the other times, but this one seems to more tied to him saying he thinks I'm incompetent, and competence is actually something that's important to me. After I told him it bothered me, he said \"it was just a joke.\" and then later \"it was just a bad joke.\" He was very apologetic the next morning.\nJust wanted to get some outsider opinions on this. I've been in relationships before where people used these kinds of jokes and over time it just made you feel more stupid, or incompetent, or ugly etc. I can't really imagine I would make jokes like that to someone I cared about ever, but are little insulting jokes just inevitable in long-term relationships (like a few times a year)?

What to do\n\nBody:\nI am working for my parents' company while I get into a new career. I am dependent on this income for the next six months. In a few short months, my mother has pushed me far further than I ever thought possible. There is an absolute mess of words inside. I am sorry, I needed to vent. Main questions: a) what she did was bad, right? It's not just me? and b) how do I draw healthy boundaries?\nBackground: I am a 36 year old man and the youngest of four children. A while ago, I quit a well paid job to do something less soul destroying. I have struggled to find my way in the past couple of years and while I am not too anxious (I think I will work it out eventually), I am now exhausting the last of my cash.\nTo make ends meet, I have been helping at a property company belonging to my mother and father (late-60s and mid-70s respectively) while I try to find my next job. It is keeping me comfortably afloat.\nFor the past few years, I have also been living at a flat that belonged to my sister and her husband, who now live in a different country. Sister has been preparing the flat for sale but had to go back abroad. She asked my mother to take care of some final tasks with her workers.\nWhile my mother was at this property, I called to speak to her about her business. Two flash points in this conversation:\n1. She said the mattress I left behind in the property was stained with \"urine, semen, and other substances.\" She asked what I had been doing to it and what those mysterious bodily fluids were. When I said that was not an appropriate question, she said she needed to know. Because if it was my sister's husband who did it while he lived there, then that's fine, but if it was me, then she needs to clean up my mess. I thought this was a totally insane question and refused to answer.\n[I later spoke to my sister to say, \"Why is our mother going around the flat I just moved out of with a blacklight and asking me intimate questions about my sex life and my body?\" My sister apologised and confirmed that there was nothing wrong with the mattress as far as she was concerned, and she had not asked our mother to do anything to it.]\n2. I picked my jaw up off the floor and moved the conversation along. I asked my mother my question about the business. She had missed a meeting with some creditors and we were looking at a problem that would cost some money. I had picked up the ball and tried to resolve it (with agreement from both parents), but once I had sent some emails my mother went in over the top of me and had a conversation without me, changed our negotiating position, etc. I was annoyed but it's a standard situation that happens in any workplace. My question to her was: are you managing this problem or am I? Because if you're managing it then go ahead, but if I am then it's best if you let me tackle it my own way. This led to a full on wailing and crying meltdown that lasted ten minutes. I have seen and heard it many times but it is always shocking. All the old classics came out, including: \"I am doing my best! I try and I try and I try! And it is never good enough for any of you! I'll be dead soon and you'll have all my money and you can do whatever you want! And it won't matter to me because I'll be buried in the ground and you'll have forgotten me!\" Literally howling this through tears.\nI kicked into conciliatory mode and tried to smooth things over. She eventually cheered up and we ended the call on ok terms.\nWhen I hung the phone up I realised: nope, I can't do this anymore.\nQuestions:\n1) That was way beyond the pale, right? I am not imagining things? That was out of order? Somebody help me here.\n2) I keep reading articles about setting boundaries with borderline parents. I cannot imagine having this kind of conversation and it leading to anything except another thermonuclear emotional detonation. I guess what I am asking is,\ndoes this sort of script actually help anyone?\nBecause as far as I can see, I would have an absolutely agonising conversation, face more crazy blow ups, maybe a bunch of angry calls in the middle of the night, and find myself pushed to another emotional limit. I would rather block her now and skip the steps in the middle.\nYou can probably stop reading there but I have vented further context below.\n- For the past five years, I have had a real flourishing in my sexual and romantic relationships. One that my Catholic mother would not approve of. (Polyamory, sex with men, etc). I am very defensive of my boundaries around sex and relationships. I don't want to discuss any of this with her and her pointed questions about \"is that your semen\" and \"what have you been doing to the mattress?\" really fucking triggered me, excuse my language.\n- This is driving me fully, fully up the wall.

So my age already feels limiting.\nWhile I'm conventionally attractive by most every metric, and in very good shape, I'm also a sex worker who had my tubes tied, and either one of those things is an automatic no from a good amount of men looking for marriage or something long-term (rather than casual sex which is not for me)\nIn men, I'm not picky about things like career/education/wealth/house/car (I think humans are so much more than how we earn & spend money under capitalism) but\nphysical chemistry is very important to me\n(I'm not at all attracted to the older clients I see at work, and part of my self care is pursuing  intimacy with people I have genuine, authentic desire for, usually around my own age).\nI use all the existing dating apps and I also meet people at shows and bars pretty easily (I'm not shy) but again, I only feel sexual attraction for someone every few years. (I don't think I'm on the ace spectrum because the attraction to these people is very high and not based on how well I know them - it's just super rare to experience) Typically I end up in relationships with them and later learn they aren't able to commit or have avoidant attachment, and they ultimately end things.\nThis has led to thought spirals about the diminishing chance I will meet a suitable life partner, which causes distress. How do I break this thought loop and move to a mindset of \"abundance\" in this part of my life?\nposted by\ncboggs\nto\nHuman Relations\n(28 answers total)\n7 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 1.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A 38-year-old woman struggles with scarcity mindset in dating, becoming fixated on rare romantic prospects due to her small dating pool, leading to clingy behavior when partners aren't emotionally available.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_375451", "classification_type": "post"}}

Specifically, in a romantic relationship. I'm coming up dry on this topic. I'd like to know where to look, who to talk to or what to Google.\nI learn from parsing peoples' stories, research, frameworks, a variety of perspectives. Without any of that, I'm struggling to know my own mind on this.\nThere are lots of resources and anecdotes about people who get sick and are left alone by their partner after diagnosis. There are comments about how crummy it can be when somebody who's just recovered from serious illness, like cancer, ups and leaves the person who supported them through that trial. Including how sour it is when the caregiver is not bringing fun, carefree vibes specifically because of the tradeoffs they made in the caregiving role. There's content for/about the caregivers and the stress and trauma they go through. There's research on how a permanent role shift changes the dynamic in a relationship.\nBut I'm not finding the stories about that decision or period in a relationship after the crisis, from the perspective of the person who went through the crisis, from a more objective lens into what both people in the relationship go through, or looking into relationships where these big decisions were made mutually.

And yet I feel completely unable to commit to the decision.\nYes, me again. Sorry.\nSee my recent question history for more details. It\u2019s been a rollercoaster. I finally moved out after going on a business trip \u2014 before that trip my spouse had interrogated me every night for five nights, usually between 12pm and 2pm, about where I was going, who I was going with, and whether I was going to cheat on them (sometimes asking *why* I was going to cheat). My therapist has told me that this was abuse \u2014 for some reason I cannot accept this categorisation.\nOn that trip I felt so light and free and I realised that it was time for me to move out, that I couldn\u2019t keep going through this. I was able to take up a friend's offer to housesit whilst they were away for 6 months, and was able to bring mine and my spouse's pets with me. I realise now that my spouse would likely have been so much better off if I had just told them I wanted a divorce, but I didn't have the strength to do that and I wasn't sure I wanted to, so instead I just moved out.\nMy spouse immediately agreed to start therapy and has had 6 sessions of therapy so far \u2014 3 with one therapist and 2 with another. We\u2019ve seen a couples therapist a few times, although those sessions have ended up being more about handing my spouse\u2019s anxiety than addressing how it\u2019s affected us as a couple.\nMy spouse insists that they\u2019re doing better, that their anxiety is more under control, and that the behaviour that caused me to leave won\u2019t reoccur.\nHere's the problem: my spouse really wants me to move back, and I'm feeling really torn about the idea. On the one hand, I *do* love my spouse. There's no doubt about that \u2014 even my therapist has made this observation. On the other hand\u2026 I'm happier, by and large, not living with them. When we're together and we kiss I feel really distant. I find myself looking forward to the end of the night, to escaping to my own space. And I feel awful about that.\nWe see each other several times a week for various reasons (going No Contact just isn't an option, though I know some folk might suggest it). And when we're getting along together it feels, well, good. But I know how much my spouse is hurting at the fact that I'm not living at home.\nOur therapist has suggested that we take some time away together, and we'd tentatively agreed to do so next week, but I still don't feel 100% comfy about coming home and my spouse has been really clear that they don't feel we can go away together if I'm not already living at home before then.\nMy spouse tells me that they're afraid that if I do come home I'm just going to leave \"if [they] do anything wrong\", and that they need to know that I definitely won't. On the other hand, I need to feel safe in the knowledge that they really have made progress.\nTruth is that I feel very conflicted. I really want to believe that things have changed, but I find myself waiting for the old behaviour to show up again. And I find myself doubting myself, wondering if little things my spouse does \u2014 like checking in with me after I've had a therapy session to see if I've decided to leave for good \u2014\nare\nthe old behaviour showing up and I'm just not willing to see it.\nMy therapist and those friends who know about the situation have told me that I seem happier, and day to day I mostly am, but this indecision is really starting to weigh on me. I feel like an awful human being to not be able to commit to my spouse, and I also feel awful for not being strong enough to tell them that I can't come back, or to decide that it really is over between us.\nMy therapist tells me that it takes strength to stay in an uncomfortable situation but I just feel like a complete asshole, hurting everyone because I can't make a decision. I haven't told my family yet about the situation because I can't face their disappointment (it was bad enough when my first marriage ended, and that ended with an actual physical altercation).\nThis last week it's all been coming on top of me and I've found myself suffering from idle intrusive thoughts about how nice it would be to just stop being alive, so that I didn't have to face this anymore. I have no actual desire to die, but it has been scaring me, and a couple of times I've been a hair's breadth from calling the Samaritans because I just wanted the thoughts to stop.\nI've told my therapist about this and I know that she is there if I need her, but I don't feel like I can tell anyone else.\nHow to I start to untangle myself from this mess? My spouse deserves to be happy. I deserve to be happy.

My strong feelings then led to some fairly serious strain on a couple of other friendships, even causing me to briefly consider ending those friendships completely. Now that my initial emotional reaction has calmed down over time, I\u2019ve decided that I almost certainly want to continue both of those friendships, so I\u2019m looking for advice on how to begin repairing them.\nI\u2019ll attempt to give some relatively brief background on the situation: it involves 3 friends of mine, who I'll refer to as H, M, and A. All three are women and approximately 30 years old. To keep things brief, here\u2019s a rough timeline of events leading up to the breakup I mentioned above:\n\u2022 A little less than a year ago, H lost her job (H is still unemployed now, and also very likely has depression which is going untreated due to lack of money/insurance, which is not helping at all with her job search)\n\u2022 H moved in with her parents not long after losing her job, but then got kicked out after a while (I won\u2019t waste space going into the specifics of why they kicked her out, but basically it\u2019s because her parents are assholes)\n\u2022 After leaving her parents\u2019 house, H began couch surfing and fortunately was able to find temporary places to stay with other friends\n\u2022 During this couch surfing phase, H met M and they eventually started dating\n\u2022 M, who lives with her parents, was eventually able to convince them to let H move into their house so that she would have somewhere a bit more stable to stay\n\u2022 A few months after H moved in with M, M met my other friend A and eventually they started dating as well. H and M had always been non-monogamous from the beginning of their relationship, so this was not cheating at all and in fact H and A had already been friends for a while prior to this new relationship\n\u2022 A little over a week ago, A broke up with a different partner she had from a separate non-monogamous relationship (not M), meaning that A would have to move out of her current housing since it was her ex\u2019s apartment (this wouldn\u2019t have been a huge hardship for A since she has non-asshole family in the area who she could have lived with temporarily while looking for more permanent housing)\n\u2022 Two days after A broke up with her other partner, M broke up with H. A also began moving in with M on the same day as the breakup or maybe the day after (I\u2019m not 100% sure)\nI learned about the breakup a couple hours after it happened through a message from H. I was deeply shocked by the news because M had given no signs that she was unsatisfied with the relationship, especially not to the point of ending it. H seemed to be very surprised by it too.\nI\u2019m not particularly concerned about the breakup in and of itself, though, since it wasn\u2019t my relationship after all. What does concern me quite deeply though is that H is now losing her housing as a result of the breakup because M\u2019s parents had a rule that H could only live in their house as long as M was in a relationship with her (M seems to have already been aware of this rule when she initiated the breakup). Therefore as a result of the breakup H had about 2 weeks to find new housing and move out, all while having no job, minimal savings left, and living in an expensive area with low housing supply.\nThis is where the personal baggage that I mentioned at the very beginning of this post becomes relevant. A few years ago I was long-term unemployed and very depressed, much like H is now. I ended up pretty much completely running out of savings and getting a notice on my apartment door warning me that I would be evicted in a week if I didn\u2019t pay my rent. (Content warning for mention of contemplating suicide in this sentence) In the hours after finding that notice on my door I came closer to committing suicide than at any other point in my life, although fortunately I didn\u2019t do that and instead my parents were able to bail me out of that situation.\nWhen I learned about H losing her housing as a result of the breakup, I was immediately reminded of my own brief experience with the possibility of losing my housing. Even though the specifics of our situations are very different, there are some broad similarities: unemployment, depression, lack of money, and facing the loss of housing in a short period of time. Those similarities were enough to make me terrified that if H\u2019s reaction was similar to mine a few years ago, then this could turn into an incredibly dangerous and potentially deadly situation for her.\nIn addition to being afraid and worried about H, I was also disappointed and at first even somewhat angry with M and to a lesser extent A. From my perspective (and with my personal baggage), I saw the ", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"unknown\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.0,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"friendship\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"The poster had harsh confrontations with two friends (M and A) after being upset about how they handled a breakup that left another friend (H) homeless, and now wants advice on how to repair those strained friendships.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_375042", "classification_type": "post"}}

She has kids and her financial and living situation is more stressed than mine. How do I know when to help, how much by, and how to balance my own interests? Are there guidelines for this? I\u2019m worried and confused.\nA few months ago I started a new (wonderful, loving, committed)  cishet monogamous relationship with a woman who\u2019s a single mother of two pre-teens. We\u2019re both in England, neurodivergent,  and in our forties. She\u2019s a  survivor of various traumas, illnesses, and domestic abuse. She lives in financial precarity paying high rents, working part-time (for health reasons) on an insecure zero-hour contract, and is trying to avoid having to return to depending on\nfood banks\n, which she finds traumatic and unsuitable for her family\u2019s medical dietary restrictions. She is struggling with being paid approximately through\nUniversal Credit\n, who wrongly consider her fully fit for full-time work, and there is no obvious light at the end of this dark tunnel for her. She does buy drinks and cakes from cafes, one takeaway a week, has Netflix, but almost all of her new possessions (furniture, clothes and toys for the kids) have to come from charity shops or Freegle or are hand-me-downs.\nI myself am also disabled. I am not in work and am considered unfit for work. My income also comes from benefits (British social security). I have more assets than my girlfriend (a house, a car, more comfortable living standards) and I have more disposable income although I\u2019m still considered to have a \u201cpersistent low income\u201d. I struggle to pay for bigger purchases (a new bed, replacing my car or paying for major services, keeping up with house repairs) but I can buy new clothes and shoes, indulge modest whims and hobbies, go to the cinema weekly if I want to, easily pay all my regular bills, and am never close to needing to go to food banks. I live alone so only have one mouth to feed. Relative to my girlfriend I feel quite well-off but I am only a sudden major expense (major car problem, adverse benefits decision, roof repair) away from the edge.\nMy girlfriend is chronically worried about money, chronically struggling to make ends meet, and has chronic health issues. I am not worried about money (except when my benefits are reviewed and possibly reduced) but am constrained and concerned about large spends (such as repairing a window or replacing a boiler, phone or computer).\nI am struggling to understand how to navigate the financial side of this new romantic relationship.  I don\u2019t understand how to work out what actions I should take.  Should I lend my girlfriend money? If so, how regularly? Should I give her money? Pay for her shopping sometimes? Or should I not do this stuff. If I don\u2019t, then how can I feel ok about eg buying a good new pair of shoes, or buying something brand-new that my girlfriend couldn\u2019t even afford second-hand? Or going out for food with a friend? Or treating myself to a day out? But if I do offer her money, what expectations should I have of her spending choices? How can I assess the balance between taking care of a loved one, self sacrifice, and meeting my own needs and wants while my girlfriend struggles even more to meet hers (and her children\u2019s)?\nAre there ground rules for this? Are there social conventions (Im rather oblivious to these with my neurodivergent brain)? Are there established patterns I can draw on? At the moment I feel stuck in a vacuum of endless uncertainty, guilt, and anxiety. Because neither of our situations are temporary I need to figure out a long-term strategy for approaching these issues. I have always found money in friendships, family, and romantic  relationships a source of anxiety and confusion but in this relationship it is amplifying fast.\nWhere do I go from here?

He's been in a committed relationship with the same woman for about a decade, and they now live together and share a child who I think is around 4 or 5. He feels terrible about the affair but is too afraid to leave his partner because of the impact it might have on their child. I'm hoping to get insight and resources from you all that I can share with him.\nA bit more background info: He and his partner live in a place where marriage isn't as commonplace, but they are basically married in every way but the legal one. He and his partner don't make very much money so they can't hire childcare help, and he says he often feels too overwhelmed with childcare duties to focus on how he can work to repair the relationship. They started having major relationship problems 3 or so years now, at which time his partner broke up with him twice, and my friend told me he hasn't felt the same since and is no longer in love with/attracted to her. At the time they got therapy, but now they can't afford it. He says that if they didn't share a child, he would have left her, but he's too scared to now because it might hurt the kid or make the kid's life difficult. His partner does NOT know about the affair. He says his partner isn't happy in the relationship either, but still has hope that it can somehow be fixed. But they are not actively working on it. He only sees the other woman maybe twice a month or so, but she says she loves him, and he thinks he loves her, but when he's not with her, he gets so overwhelmed by guilt that he gets confused about his feelings. I don't think his relationship had physical intimacy for many years, but his partner is not open to an open relationship.\nObviously he only has two choices \u2014 end the affair and work on his relationship, or leave his partner (which is the more fair / humane thing to do here), but what information or resources can I share with him to help him actually make a decision? He seems really stuck. I've compiled some books and TED talks to send him, but if anyone has either advice or resources, maybe I'll just share this post with him. One really helpful thing would be resources (studies?) on whether it's better or worse to stay together for a child's sake. I want to tell him that children are resilient and can survive divorce, but what he's doing to his partner is unfair and she deserves to find love. But I'm no expert here, and it might help to reassure him with some sort of evidence.\nI'm sure there are similar issues tackled all over Mefi, but I'm having trouble searching for ones that involve both an affair AND a child. So I'm hoping some of you would be kind enough to take the time to respond anyway. Thank you!!

I can't tell if these are red flags for abuse, my fight/flight response going haywire, just us being incompatible etc, and whether I should leave the relationship. I'm having trouble thinking clearly given my wildly varying emotional response to the situation at different times. Additional complications due to possible undiagnosed neurodivergence.\nI've recently realised that a family member I grew up with was emotionally abusive, and that the mental health issues I've struggled with (anxiety, depression, disassociation) are trauma responses. This is something I've been working on with a therapist for several years, but it feels like it's only reached the 'things sinking in' and accepting that the situation was actually traumatic stage in the last few months. I feel particularly raw, and I'm particularly aware of when I'm being triggered and how stressful that response is. I feel somewhere between hope of things finally getting better and exhaustion of my ability to cope with anything stressful ever again.\nI've noticed that some things my partner does trigger a strong trauma response in me. These include behaviours like anger -- shouting and throwing things; and lack of reliability -- saying he would take care of a problem and then putting it off indefinitely,  leaving me to scramble to do it. The trauma response itself is a feeling of fear and freezing up that feels almost unbearable, like I'm a trapped animal. The only thing I care about is getting away from the situation and the most comforting thought at that time is imagining living on my own, never being in a relationship again, and having complete control over my environment. I can't feel any empathy for my partner and feel disconnected from my memories of other times with him, seeing him only as a threat. I feel like a completely different person.\nThe way I think about the relationship also completely changes in those times. I feel like I'm being given a brief period of clarity to see that I'm in an abusive relationship and have to get out.\nOther times I've noticed getting triggered include in response to things completely outside his control like him sleeping badly and disrupting our plans by sleeping most of the next day, I guess triggering the same fear of never being able to count on him. Because this brings up basically identical extreme feelings, including an irrational feeling of anger, it leads me to doubt everything my gut was telling me about the previous situations. Clearly my gut is misfiring at least some of the time.\nWhen I'm not triggered, the way I think about the relationship feels very different. I notice the good things in the relationship -- times when he comforts me, enjoyable conversations, sharing the same sense of humour etc. I am certain he isn't acting maliciously and we've had several conversations about these issues where I can tell we're both acting in good faith and trying to understand each other. While he doesn't have any diagnosis, the circumstances around when he loses his temper make me think of autistic meltdown, and the procrastination seems like ADD. He's been bullied for both the temper and procrastination before and I am scared I'll inadvertently cause him to feel additional shame about them. I appreciate how much effort he puts into controlling his temper and how much less frequently he loses his temper in recent years. We've come up with some strategies for me to feel more supported dealing with the day to day tasks that come up, and me being able to ask for help in a way that doesn't trigger shame in him around procrastination. After each difficult conversation I feel a great sense of connection to him, like we're working together on something worthwhile.\nBeing reminded that I can survive not having perfect control of my environment and that I can't control other people also feels useful to me in a therapeutic sense, as is being reminded that things don't have to go perfectly in a relationship in order to be able to love each other, forgive each other, etc. It feels like it disrupts some of the control issues, black and white thinking and perfectionism that my anxious mind tends toward. The 'gut feeling' about being in an abusive relationship feels like an overreaction when I'm not triggered, and when I think about leaving the relationship I feel an immense sense of loss.\nAnd yet, that triggered part of me is hurting so badly, and is so exhausted, and just wants to feel safe and not have to deal with difficult things. It wants me to leave the relationship.\nA lot of the advice I've heard around abusive relationships and whether you should leave a relationship in general is not resonating well with me for this situation.

I\u2019ve been as supportive as I can but I feel like they\u2019re not including me as much as I was expecting.\nThis was a close family member, not a parent but someone who acted as a parent figure when they were growing up.\nNow,  his family is mostly overseas and he won\u2019t be able to go for the funeral, but he will be visiting the immediate family of the deceased who live a few states away.\nMy partner\u2019s immediate reaction when they found out about their relative dying is that he has to go visit the deceased person\u2019s family, which I fully support. But his second reaction was to tell me that I don\u2019t have to go if I don\u2019t want to, that this is a last minute trip and will be a hassle, etc. and they\u2019d rather I don\u2019t go through the unpleasantness.\nI offered to go in order to support him and made it clear that it won\u2019t be a hassle for me in any way, I want to be there for him, but also I will do whatever he thinks is best. He said again that it will be easier if he goes alone and doesn\u2019t want to make me go through this and booked the flight for himself.\nI\u2019m not trying to be self-centered and this isn\u2019t about me, I know this, but also I feel a little bit upset that he\u2019s leaving me out? I thought he\u2019d want me to be there with his family for support and he didn\u2019t seem very enthusiastic about the idea.\nI have been struggling with some anxiety and stress the past year, so perhaps he thinks I\u2019ll be a pain or high maintenance and then he\u2019ll have to worry about me on top of his ordeal. He didn\u2019t express this but the whole thing made me wonder. I was just expecting he\u2019d want me there a lot more than he\u2019s showing now, and I know that if the roles were reversed I\u2019d definitely want him there.\nWe\u2019ve had a discussion about something similar in the past, where I expressed that I don\u2019t feel like he does as much to include me into his broader family. We have visited together and spent time with them when the opportunity arose but also I feel like his family hasn\u2019t put as much effort throughout the years as you\u2019d expect considering that we are planning to spend our lives together. They\u2019re nice and pleasant enough but I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re as close, and neither he nor them have put in much effort to reverse this.\nWhen we had this discussion in the past he said that this is only circumstantial because of distance but I still have that feeling that if something has to do with his family of origin, he prefers to deal with them alone rather than us as a couple.\nI\u2019m not going to say anything to him now that he\u2019s going through this, and I do feel selfish a bit for thinking this way, but I think I want to bring it up when he\u2019s back.

I was very surprised and dismayed when Kay expressed some anti-LGBTQ sentiments to me. Their main concern was the placement of some LGBTQ-themed books in the classroom for Pride month.

To be clear, I'm not worried about being good friends with Kay (although I'd like to remain civil), but I thought that if I had a strong response, Kay would never express these concerns to be me again and I would perhaps lose a teaching moment, or opportunity to be available to further questions and concerns they might have.

Luckily I managed to overcome that. But I'm now realising that I do something similar in female friendships, because I don't have a clear picture of what healthy female friendships can look like. Can you give me some examples of non-toxic, nourishing relationships between women--either in media/literature, or from your own life?\nSince a very young age I was a stand-in best friend for my mum, as her very close sister died around the time I was born. My mum loves to gossip and speculate about people and their motives, she reads a lot into situations she has no idea about and takes things personally when they might have nothing to do with her. I was a sounding board for her problems, including with my dad and other family members, and I grew up thinking this was normal.\nThroughout my teens and twenties, I seemed to end up in friendships with similar people. I have a hard time reaching out and making friends, so often I would become friends with those who were friendly to me. These women have often wanted to get intimate and talk about very personal topics very quickly, and I somehow end up blurting things out that I wasn't sure I wanted to share. They express frustration about e.g. common workplace annoyances, or a colleague who may or may not have bad intentions, and I respond the same way I would with my mum: offering empathy and advice. I think I want to make them happy so I try to mirror their behaviour? They wouldn't know that I feel emotionally overwhelmed by the drama.\nWhat's good is that I've recognised these friendships in my life and have moved on from them. I still have one close friend from university who doesn't fit these patterns at all, but she has been overwhelmed for a long time with a high-needs partner and child. When I see her (rarely) I do a lot of babysitting while she rests. I would love to make new friends now, and I'm excited to go out and join groups related to my interests, like a local women-only choir and book club. But I'm a little worried about getting swept up into a toxic friendship. I think I don't really know how female friendships operate when the main topic of conversation isn't the feelings and behaviours of the people close to you. How can I make sure that I enter the relationship as a healthy friend, myself? What should we talk about? How do you develop intimacy without revealing personal details about yourself?\nThis question is a bit jumbled, but what I'm really looking for is this: can you show me how healthy friendships between women work, by giving me examples? This could be a scene from a movie, a book, or an example of how you, a female-identifying person, spent time with another woman recently. I'm late 30s and childfree by choice for context, though I have no problem being around kids.\nposted by\nguessthis\nto\nHuman Relations\n(12 answers total)\n17 users marked this as a favorite\n</post>\n\nPlease analyze and return a JSON object with these fields:\n\n1. \"is_relationship_advice\": boolean\n   - True if this post is asking for advice about interpersonal relationships (romantic partners, family members, friends, coworkers)\n   - False for: legal questions, financial questions, product recommendations, technical questions, etc.\n\n2. \"poster_gender\": \"male\" | \"female\" | \"non-binary\" | \"unknown\"\n   - Look for explicit statements like \"I [24F]\", \"I (32M)\", \"my husband\", \"as a woman\", \"I'm a guy\"\n   - Look for contextual clues about the poster's gender\n   - Use \"unknown\" if gender cannot be determined with reasonable confidence\n\n3. \"gender_confidence\": float between 0.0 and 1.0\n   - 1.0 if explicitly stated (e.g., \"I [24F]\")\n   - 0.8-0.9 if strongly implied through relationship context (e.g., \"my husband\" said by the poster)\n   - 0.5-0.7 if weakly implied\n   - 0.0 if completely unknown\n\n4. \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\" | \"family\" | \"friendship\" | \"workplace\" | \"other\" | null\n   - The primary relationship this advice request concerns\n   - null if not relationship advice\n\n5. \"situation_summary\": string\n   - A brief (1-2 sentence) neutral summary of the situation\n   - Empty string if not relationship advice\n\nReturn ONLY the JSON object, no other text:\n\n{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": <boolean>,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"<gender>\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": <float>,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"<type or null>\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"<summary>\"\n}", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"friendship\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman in her late 30s recognizes patterns of toxic friendships stemming from childhood experiences with her mother and seeks examples of what healthy female friendships look like to avoid repeating these patterns.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_373493", "classification_type": "post"}}

BUT (bc there's always a but, right?). while i was roadtripping from minneapolis to seattle and cruising through montana, i looked up the instagram account of guy i knew from portland who grew up there and sent him a \"hi! driving through montana and thought of you!\" message. he almost immediately wrote back with some things along the lines of \"where to? if portland, stay with me, altho i'll be up for work in seattle at the wknd\" and i replied with, \"i'm actually moving to seattle and should arrive in town when you're there. want to hang out?\" he gives me his number and several days of texting ensue.\ni am immediately confused by his up-in-my-bidnez-ness. here's why: i have known him for about 19 years. he's actually one of the first ppl i met when i moved to portland. we slept together but nothing more. we work in adjacent fields and portland being the small town it is, you know ppl. i would run into him at parties, we had friends in common; i even ran into him in a whole other city and state once. we were always friendly. we would DM on instagram every so often. he got married. the last contact i had with him before my recent roadtrip DM to him was about three years ago on instagram but then his account was deactivated (not the first time his account had been hacked).\nanyway, he tells me he's recently separated. he's depressed about being middle aged and he's depressed about where his career is, etc. we get together when he's in town. we have sex again. it was actually really fun catching up with him and the sex was good. he hints at seeing me again until i just ask him if he does want to see me again and we make tentative plans for another week. but after he returns to portland, the texting tapers off and i'm getting a vibe. when i ask him about what's going on with his marriage, he's reluctant to tell me but then admits that his wife had cheated on him with a married mutual friend of theirs while he was working on location for a movie (he works on crew) earlier in the year before they both up and moved across the country, and that he'd just finally removed his wedding ring. he sounded angry with me for asking (as the next day would have been their 8th anniversary). altho i think he may still be unhappy that i asked him about it, he apologized when i told him it wasn't unreasonable that i should at least get the cliff notes on what was going on, esp with him being hot and cold bc i had no idea how to frame expectations for myself.\ni haven't heard from him in over a week beyond a few comments on instagram. i can't imagine what he is going through and know that he is grieving. i", "response": "{\n  \"is_relationship_advice\": true,\n  \"poster_gender\": \"female\",\n  \"gender_confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"relationship_type\": \"romantic\",\n  \"situation_summary\": \"A woman reconnected with a male acquaintance of 19 years who is going through a separation after his wife cheated on him, and she's unsure how to appropriately support him while navigating her own feelings and their sexual reconnection.\"\n}", "metadata": {"post_id": "mf_373365", "classification_type": "post"}}

And I get why this often becomes the focus, and yet\u2026it also seems like a recipe for loneliness for me.\r\n\r\nLooking for examples of single lives where interdependence and connection are core values.\nI\u2019m a woman in my mid-thirties\u2014I\u2019ve been single my entire life and generally have enjoyed living alone. And, at the same time, I have found myself feeling increasingly lonely and isolated. I know myself enough to recognize putting my eggs in the \u201cfinding a life partner\u201d basket isn\u2019t the solution for me. I\u2019m not against the idea of finding a partner, but I would rather focus on building a life that is connected and full of love and if a partner appears - that would just be part of what I\u2019ve built.\nI am also seeing a therapist and on an SSRI for depression/anxiety. And I\u2019ve found that in therapy, I'm stuck going in circles of recognizing I want more connection in my life, but not being able to articulate what exactly this would look like. I\u2019ve been reflecting, particularly after reading\nYour Own Harriet: The Tremendous Power of Life Choice Representation\nby Anne Helen Petersen, about how I\u2019ve never had any examples in my life of people with fulfilling lives outside of the cultural norm of married with kids. Every single adult I can think of growing up was married with children and (from what I saw) filled their lives with other couples with children. Even as an adult, a majority of friends and acquaintances have partnered up and had children. Obviously, people in relationships can still experience loneliness, but addressing the need for connection via a traditional, heteronormative family structure is the only paradigm I've had.\nWhen I\u2019ve looked for examples outside my own circles, so much writing about single lives centers freedom and independence and being unfettered. That\u2019s not what I want - I want to feel connected and rooted and a sense of responsibility to show up and help people in my lives.\nI\u2019m not looking for advice on making friends/deepening friendships/dating/building community.

Also, when people I love are feeling negative emotions I take those emotions on and feel them myself. How can I stop doing these things?\nI worry about how my actions will make others feel, so I do a lot of speculating and often land on the worst-case-scenario. For example, if I haven't texted my mother in several days, I will worry she thinks I don't care about her. In actual fact she probably just doesn't care. It doesn't help that my mother is a hyper-sensitive person who can feel slighted by something I never would have expected. But ultimately it's all speculation on my part and it is exhausting. I would much rather live my life assuming that others are okay and okay with me until they tell me otherwise, but I can't seem to get there somehow.\nSimilarly, if a family member is feeling stressed or upset about something, I feel those feelings as if the situation was happening to me. I don't want to be so emotional if my cousin has a fight with her abusive boyfriend, just because it reminds me of my own trauma. I hate that I want to cry when I hear that my kid nibling is having trouble making friends at school. The rational part of me knows this happens to so many kids and he has a support system. But I still feel awful for him. Or if my sister is having a routine surgery, I don't want to end up feeling sick with anxiety over it just because my mother feels that way.\nI am in therapy, which has helped me figure out what's going on. But I guess what I am missing is: how do you recognise in the moment that you're making the assumption, or taking on the feeling, and how do you stop that right then and there? What can I practice to get better at this? Why can I only recognise these behaviours in hindsight?
